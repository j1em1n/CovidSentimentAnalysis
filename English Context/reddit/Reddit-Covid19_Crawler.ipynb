      "It was just next to a table of dining patrons and I horrified.\n",
      ">there is so much that is still unknown about this virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be frank, no, the virus has been fully sequenced and it's type has been studied by scientists for...ages now. It's a variation of a known type.\n",
      "\n",
      ">How does it become so infectious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just the nature of the beast. Coronavirus family is highly infectious. Covid-19 is no different.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Is it true that the main method of transmission is droplet and not airborne, or are people just guessing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, here's the thing that people get confused about between layman terms and technical terms. In technical terms, \"airborne transmission\" means the virus can travel on dust particles or tiny, aerosolised respiratory droplets, whereas \"droplet transmission\" means larger respiratory droplets. Covid is *definitely* transmissible by droplet, so if someone sneezes and touches something, that surface is contaminated. Or if someone with it coughs/sneezes on you, then it can spread. But the latter, transmission by dust particle or aerosolised respiratory droplets? No confirmation yet - and frankly, it's not the major vector. The former is. So while you *might* be able to get covid by an infected person breathing on you or sneezing into the air some distance from you, there's been no confirmed cases of such happening and even if there were, there aren't enough cases for the WHO to consider a major vector over droplet transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      ">I haven't read accounts of people being in contact with others who were coughing or sneezing violently, so transmission may be a lot more insidious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transmission isn't insidious, really. It's pretty well documented by now. People tend to touch their faces a lot more than they realise.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Are asymptomatic cases truly not contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no confirmed asymptomatic cases. Only two *possible* asymptomatic spreads so far. Frankly, we won't know it until a large scale study spanning years will figure how much of an issue asymptomatic spread is. For the time being, it's effectively irrelevant as long as you take the basic hygiene measures (which frankly, you should be doing even if there wasn't a flu epidemic).\n",
      "\n",
      ">Also, does the virus mutate to become stronger or weaker?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both. Just that you won't hear about weaker mutations since the body can just fight that off more easily, and so far, not really a cause of concern for stronger mutations.\n",
      "I think even if that is done, there still won't be enough masks in the long run. Taiwan produces surgical masks but I believe we don't? ST Engineering creates Air+ which is an N95 mask, and is only recently being relocated back to SG after being based on Taiwan.\n",
      "Are you able to work from home? I was having flu last week (doctor gave me 5 days mc) but I requested to work from home this week as well, just to be on the safe side.\n",
      "Most sources indicate that Runny Nose/Sneezing is NOT a symptom of COVID 19\n",
      "I know how you feel as I have a nose sensitivity issue too. It could be caused by many reasons, e.g. sick building or even temperature change. Take care okay?\n",
      "Can you wear a mask at work? When i had the flu/cold even before covid19, I always wore a mask to prevent spreading to colleagues but I also found that it helps bring some relief from the aircon.\n",
      "Yes, I was trying to be polite in my language and not to be so assertive. Lol.\n",

      ">How does it become so infectious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just the nature of the beast. Coronavirus family is highly infectious. Covid-19 is no different.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Is it true that the main method of transmission is droplet and not airborne, or are people just guessing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, here's the thing that people get confused about between layman terms and technical terms. In technical terms, \"airborne transmission\" means the virus can travel on dust particles or tiny, aerosolised respiratory droplets, whereas \"droplet transmission\" means larger respiratory droplets. Covid is *definitely* transmissible by droplet, so if someone sneezes and touches something, that surface is contaminated. Or if someone with it coughs/sneezes on you, then it can spread. But the latter, transmission by dust particle or aerosolised respiratory droplets? No confirmation yet - and frankly, it's not the major vector. The former is. So while you *might* be able to get covid by an infected person breathing on you or sneezing into the air some distance from you, there's been no confirmed cases of such happening and even if there were, there aren't enough cases for the WHO to consider a major vector over droplet transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      ">I haven't read accounts of people being in contact with others who were coughing or sneezing violently, so transmission may be a lot more insidious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transmission isn't insidious, really. It's pretty well documented by now. People tend to touch their faces a lot more than they realise.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Are asymptomatic cases truly not contagious?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no confirmed asymptomatic cases. Only two *possible* asymptomatic spreads so far. Frankly, we won't know it until a large scale study spanning years will figure how much of an issue asymptomatic spread is. For the time being, it's effectively irrelevant as long as you take the basic hygiene measures (which frankly, you should be doing even if there wasn't a flu epidemic).\n",
      "\n",
      ">Also, does the virus mutate to become stronger or weaker?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both. Just that you won't hear about weaker mutations since the body can just fight that off more easily, and so far, not really a cause of concern for stronger mutations.\n",
