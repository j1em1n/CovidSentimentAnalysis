> # S’pore researchers invent Covid-19 test that can tell if someone’s infected in 5 minutes

> A team of scientists at Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) has developed a new test which will be able to tell if someone is infected with Covid-19 in as fast as five minutes.

> How it works

> A patient’s secretions are first collected from a swab.

> The test then looks for the genetic material of Covid-19 in the secretions.

> After that, the sample will be put in a portable device which will give the result in about five to 10 minutes.

> According to The Straits Times, the test uses an extremely rapid amplification method that the team have named “Cepat”, which also happens to mean ‘fast’ in Malay.

> Professor Jackie Ying, who heads the NanoBio Lab at A*Star said,

> “We have done some preliminary clinical validation at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital using real patients’ samples, and found the test to be very sensitive and accurate.”

> Fastest test in the world if approved

> The team hopes to submit an approval for the test in the next month.

> If approved, this would be the fastest Covid-19 test globally as of now.

> The test can then be used in hospitals, as well as in general practitioner clinics.

> The scientists had worked on this test for around six weeks after A*Star’s chief executive Frederick Chew gave them the challenge of coming up with rapid tests for Covid-19.

> Standard lab tests take about two to three hours before showing results, and about 60 per cent of time is spent “molecular photocopier” to heat up, ST explained.

> The “molecular photocopier” amplifies the genetic material of a virus to enable easy detection.

> Using an enzyme the team has developed, however, Cepat can “photocopy” the virus’ DNA/RNA within a minute.

> Another detection test kit developed by local firm

> Another Singapore-based firm, Veredus Laboratories, had previously developed a three-hour detection test kit for Covid-19.

> The test kit had obtained provisional authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and has been deployed at the air, sea and land checkpoints.

> They are also used directly by labs and hospitals to test patients for clinical diagnosis.

> The entire screening process is completed in three hours.

> The test also has an accuracy of more than 99 per cent and is able to identify Covid-19 with high specificity and sensitivity.

Yeah must be intentional. This was co-developed with her Malay PhD student. So having a Malay acronym makes perfect sense. It is our national language after all.

=== Author: CCVork===
""Happens to mean"" is usually just a way of saying they didn't name it because of the meaning.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
Mothershit, what do you expect.

=== Author: omnirai===
The implication is that ""cepat"" is not explicitly named this way to mean fast, and it just so happens that the final name ended up as ""cepat"". It's likely an acronym. 

Of course the way it usually is, they'll change a few words here and there to make the acronym sound catchy.

=== Author: zoinks10===
It says they have an enzyme that rapidly (1 min) duplicates the viral DNA (RNA?) so it can be detected more quickly.

That's very unlikely to happen so fast. Pardon for the lack of sources.

If it's ready for public use now, will anyone use it? The reason why vaccines take so long to be public is because they have to undergo testing, first in animals then in humans before being cleared for effectiveness and safety. 

There are already news of vaccines being created, and undergoing testing in an accelerated manner. It shows how serious the COVID-19 threat is.

>Normally, researchers would take months to test for the possibility of vaccine enhancement in animals. Given the urgency to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, some drugmakers are moving straight into small-scale human tests, without waiting for the completion of such animal tests.

What rubbish. You think vaccines come out of thin air?

=== Author: donhoavon===
introverts rise up! and go back to your rooms

=== Author: SamBellFromSarang===
But u/ccvork is right. Because newspapers cannot ""assume"". If they were not explicitly told the name is named after the Malay word, they can't say so. To play it safe, they used that specific wording, which sufficiently lets people know without digging themselves a hole.

=== Author: omnirai===
Cepat is most likely an acronym, if they put it that way. It's not unusual to name scientific innovations in this manner, to make it more eye-catching. I can't find a mention of it in the article but if I had to guess? Constant *something polymerase amplification test. Something like that you know. 

That is, they didn't name it with the explicit intention of having it mean fast in Malay, hence ""happens to"". Of course it's hard to say whether they might have changed their word choices a bit to force it this way.

**HELPING EMPLOYEES STAY EMPLOYED** 

The Jobs Support Scheme and enhanced Wage Credit Scheme were introduced in Budget 2020.

The  Government will raise its co-funding ratio for wages from 8 per cent to  25 per cent for each worker and raise the monthly qualifying wage  ceiling to S$4,600 from S$3,600.

Firms in badly affected industries like aviation will get even more.

It will also extend it by another two quarters, with payouts in May, July and October 2020.

More than one-third of the Resiliance Package will be to save jobs and support workers.

=== Author: Xanthon===
$55 billion to aid the citizens and companies through this pandemic. 11% of our GDP.  
  
Holy motherfucking shit.  
  
Edit: Damn. The government suddenly went super saiyan and unleashed all their power. CoVID-19 has no chance at our economy.

=== Author: septeal===
 26/03/2020 15:55             **S$48 BILLION RESILIENCE BUDGET**   

This will likely be the worst economic contraction since independence, says Mr Heng.

The  whole package will be worth S$48 billion - more than seven times the  S$6.4 billion in the first tranche of COVID-19 support measures. 

""Altogether, we are dedicating close to S$55 billion to support people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our GDP.""

=== Author: septeal===
**HELPING THE SELF-EMPLOYED**

Self-employed  workers will get direct cash assistance to help them tide over the  difficult times. They include real estate agents, media and art  freelancers and sports coaches.

There will be a S$1.2  billion SEP (Self-Employed Persons) Income Relief Scheme to provide  eligible self-employed persons with S$1,000 a month for nine months.

The  SEP Training Support Scheme will be extended to December and its hourly  training allowance raised from S$7.50 to S$10 from May 1 onwards.

=== Author: septeal===
**SUPPORTING THE UNEMPLOYED**

The  Government will also exercise more flexibility for ComCare schemes to  make sure Singaporeans affected by the COVID-19 crisis can get help.

It  will introduce a temporary relief fund in April to provide immediate  financial assistance to families that need help urgently.

A  COVID-19 Support Grant will be launched from May to September to give  S$800 a month for three months to workers who become unemployed due to  COVID-19, while they find new jobs or go for training.

=== Author: septeal===
 **MORE GROCERY VOUCHERS**

Grocery vouchers for adult Singaporeans in one-room and two-room flats will be tripled to S$300 from S$100.

They will receive a total of S$400 over 2020 and 2021.

=== Author: Jammy_buttons2===
Woah government really trying to save people's job

=== Author: septeal===
**TRIPLE CASH PAYOUT FOR SINGAPOREANS**

At  Budget 2020, Mr Heng had announced that all adult Singaporeans will get  a one-off cash payout of S$100 to S$300 depending on their income as  part of the Care and Support Package.

This has been tripled, so all Singaporeans 21 and above in 2020 will get between S$300 and S$900.

The payout for each parent with at least one Singaporean child aged 20 and below in 2020 has also been tripled to S$300.

**PROPERTY TAX REBATE**

A property tax rebate announced at Budget 2020 will be enhanced.

Qualifying  commercial properties which have been badly affected by COVID-19, such  as hotels, will pay no property tax, up from 15 to 30 per cent.

All  other non-residential properties to get a new 30 per cent rebate for  the year 2020. He urges landlords to pass the savings to tenants.

=== Author: septeal===
 **PRICE HIKES DEFERRED; LOAN REPAYMENT, SOME CHARGES SUSPENDED**

All hikes in Government fees and charges are to be deferred for a year, from Apr 1, 2020 to Mar 31, 2021.

All  loan repayment and interest rates will also be suspended, from Jun 1  this year to May 31, 2021. This applies to all graduates who have taken a  government loan for their university and polytechnic studies.

The Government will also suspend all late payment charges on arrears for three months for those struggling with HDB mortgage payments.

=== Author: septeal===
**DEFERMENT OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS FOR FIRMS, SELF-EMPLOYED**

To  ease cash flow for businesses, Mr Heng announced an automatic deferment  of income tax payments for companies and self-employed workers for  three months.

For companies, the deferment will be for  April, May and June. For the self-employed, the deferment will be until  July, and payments only start in August.. 

Employees may approach IRAS if they need help with their tax payments.

There are too many to list and each have tiers.

Anyone who says this is wayang obviously has zero empathy; or lack the ability to recognize genuine emotions. You can tell this is really taking a toll on the guy - and for that, we should all be grateful for the job that he's doing.

He looks and sounds tired himself.

People complained about the ministers' and their high pay, but these ministers are also doing the high stress jobs. Literally leading a country through a crisis right now. Trying to think ahead for the country, planning and strategising, not just how to deal with the crisis, but also how to help the country recover when the crisis is over. 

Makes me sad to read some of the armchair critics, criticising everything the G tries to implement. And then, also those COVIDIOTS, going out for ""one last party"" before the clubs shutdown..... \*eye roll to max\*

I never really felt the high pay was a big deal.  
It’s tough work, family safety, personal time are sacrificed and most of the time you’ll hear more hate than appreciation. Plenty of jobs out there with high pay that doesn’t put you on public dartboard.
At least they don’t need to worry about financial issues.

That said, I admit, sometimes i wonder if some of our ministers are on the right track.

Covid19 has shown me how irrational human beings can be. And the impact we do as individuals.

If Singapore hadn't handled the crisis so well, they could have ended up like Italy or Spain, as they were among the first to be impacted. The fact that there have only been two deaths, and that daily life, and the economy has continued functioning in most part, is testament to how well this crisis has been managed. 

If you were to quantify economically, how much value has been retained during this crisis, it will be in the billions. Enough to pay your ministers ten times their salary for the next ten years.

They seem to be well worth their salary when compared against politicians from other nations.

I think politicians shouldn't be working **solely** for the money. But they should be well compensated, and they should make decisions for the good of the people, instead of their own pockets. 

IMO, politics / leadership is a calling. Im mighty impressed by our leadership thus far. This entire crisis, they've been steady at the helm, calling the right shots, making the right adjustments, and more importantly, calming the people down.

My source tells me that there was a stock check by MOH on the amount of these two drugs that hospitals were holding and it was discovered that the number of prescriptions of these drugs had spiked recently, most of them as a result of self-prescriptions by hospital doctors who are allowed in the Singapore healthcare system to prescribe medication for one another. As a result, hospital stock of these two drugs are considerably lower than expected and many doctors have undergone questioning because it is suspected that they are stocking these drugs for themselves and their families. These two drugs are also no longer to be allowed for self-prescription.

It is naive to think that this sort of thing has never happened before. When there was a surgical mask shortage a few weeks ago, so many nurses and doctors were pinching masks from hospitals (for themselves and their families) that MOH had to step in and order the hospitals to ration surgical masks. If you don't believe me, go ask your friends who work as nurses and doctors in public hospitals. In Hong Kong, surgical and N95 masks were even put under lock and chains to stop hospital staff from 'overusing' them.

If your source for your allegation against SG public sector doctors is a report on doctors **in the US**, then I suggest you should just stop commenting instead of digging a deeper hole and embarrassing yourself further.

Also, posting the same comment 3 times in the same thread doesn't make it any more true, it just makes you look more desperate and sad.

I predicted the timing (4 pm) correctly. The announcement was made at 5 pm by MOH.

If you don't believe what I say, it's fine. It's very easy to prove me wrong. Just ask doctors who work in restructured hospitals if it is true that they are no longer allowed to prescribe hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for each other.

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
Then you obviously have no idea what hired guns means in this context  😂

=== Author: redwithin===
Actually I was mostly inclined to believe you on that. It's not hard to imagine that there are doctors who would do that, and it seems like a prudent measure to stop any unnecessary prescription whatsoever.

I just really found it odd that you used this as an example to ask people to believe you. It was far from exclusive knowledge, and I'd heard second-hand from most of my civil service friends by then on that day.

With 200K citizens returning, it'll be interesting to see how the healthcare system copes with community transmission. The multiplier effect resulting from an infected individual cannot be underestimated. 

Without a full lockdown - even a temporary one - one can be pretty certain about what is to happen in the days ahead.

Food takeaways should be enforced by now but why are people still allowed to sit down in food courts, cafes and restaurants?

So, lives or GDP first? Many fear losing their jobs in the event of a lockdown but the fact that losing one's life  equates to no job forever. In an unlikely but worse case scenario, who will the government turn to when there're no more workers left to turn the wheels of the GDP?

> Of the new cases, 38 were imported cases with travel history to Europe, North America, ASEAN and other parts of Asia. All except one were returning residents and long-term pass holders.

> Five more patients have recovered and were discharged, bringing the total to 160. Two patients died last Saturday.

> On Wednesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament that Singapore has increased the number of teams for contact tracing from three to 20 in order to prepare for an ""expected surge"" in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks.

> 

> Mr Gan said that with around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans returning home from all over the world, the number of cases will continue to rise.

> 

> The health minister also noted that while Singapore has sufficient capacity in its healthcare system to handle the COVID-19 outbreak, the country cannot be complacent and needs to preserve its buffer capacity.

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted in Parliament that there was no need to stockpile food and other essential supplies despite tightened measurements to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

> His comments came a day after a slew of initiatives - such as limiting gatherings outside of school and work and closing entertainment venues such as night clubs, karaoke outlets and cinemas - was announced to curb the coronavirus outbreak.

One week lockdown. No harm to try. Treat it like an extended CNY without house visits. Many companies take one week breaks during CNY, Hari Raya, Christmas etc. Do they lose business? Nay. It’s just our fears holding us back.

based case 12

=== Author: dothisnowww===
With the rise in global cases, and the short delay before SHN was enforced on everyone arriving from overseas, it isn't surprising. Just hope people can do their part and stay home so widespread transmission of the virus is prevented

=== Author: Klubeht===
I think the danger is not to the kids themselves, but rather them potentially spreading it around. Think the trend shows that the youngsters are remarkably resistant/not really affected by the virus for some reason.
It's the parents and who the parents might spread to is the danger

=== Author: Varantain===
> Then you see the details and realise the sparkletots cluster is all adults...

It's crazy how infectious the virus is. I don't think those adults were sharing food at a restaurant (like the Hyatt or SAFRA clusters) or shaking hands.

Could kids be a reservoir for the virus to spread to adults?

=== Author: riotgrrlbones===
Kids have been proven in various studies and overseas situations to be vectors for transmission. They are less likely to show symptoms yet shed the virus to adults. Schools are going to be create invisible hotspots if left unchecked, especially with grandparents looking after kids at home. Asking the elderly to stay at home while kids/ rest of the family is going out and about (potentially bringing the virus back) is not safe. 

Measures we take towards schools and workplaces can make a difference. Check out this projection modelling study funded by MOH on mitigation measures: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30162-6/fulltext

279k-1.2m Covid cases w/o measures VS. 1.8k cases with immediate school closure and 50% workforce on WFH for 2 weeks. Stats are based on 80 days after 100 community transmitted cases.

=== Author: 557088===
Children are less likely to show symptoms

=== Author: luminarae1===
I think it's probably inevitable that we'll see some kids from the Fengshan sparkletots contracting it in the next couple days (touch wood) - but preschools have always been a great breeding ground for infections like HFMD and the common cold. Considering how infectious COVID-19 is, I think the next week is gonna be a pretty big spike until they trace down every last contact of this cluster.

=== Author: rdjedd===
Was thinking that too, the reported 3 International schools now with cases, have all been adults (teachers or parents) no kids. That said, I don't think thats justification enough thst kids won't get it.

Close the schools. I was on the fence less then 48 hrs ago, but were in the 600s now in numbers. Shut it down.

=== Author: ch3rri_===
lol, no nid say so fast, tmr confirm got alot more from that cluster

=== Author: xdKme===
Right now that's what's happening but honestly is just a ticking time bomb before a student in school gets the virus from a sick teacher and spreads it. At the same time students maybe more resistant to it but are also carriers to it. honestly I say it's imminent la at this point give it 1-2 weeks the no. of cases will keep on going up and eventually there will transmission to the kids

=== Author: ryuuheii===
Unfortunately they don't (have time to) put the travel dates any more. I wonder if those cases were under SHN and it's a case of the ineffectiveness of household members continuing on as normal while someone serves SHN.

=== Author: Durian881===
Other than this new cluster, there are also lots of silent carriers spreading in our community. Based on MOH's latest update, there are currently **44 locally transmitted cases without any links** to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions.

This info is found in para 5 of the update.  [https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/five-more-cases-discharged-73-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/five-more-cases-discharged-73-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed)

and yet people will comment ""WE NEED TO STEP UP CONTACT TRACING!!!!"" ""WHY CANNOT TRACE FASTER"" knn so easy you do lor

=== Author: tenbre===
The contact tracing teams also growing exponentially

=== Author: evilplushie===
I wonder what they're going to do after this blows over

=== Author: tenbre===
Maybe this one isn't patient zero

=== Author: theblahking11===
For a pre-school, a teacher to meet 8-10 people seems a little weird. Unless there was PTM, there is no way she would have spent more than 5 minutes with any parent.

Assuming that 8-10 people are directly infected by teacher and rest through them

=== Author: csf09===
Previously they wanted to just close it for 1 day and disinfect the place yikessssssss

=== Author: bondbandito===
>first they announced they were only closing it for a day for deep cleaning. Then later, prata flip to two weeks. Now its a new cluster.

Well said.

=== Author: Raosei===
I agree. I know that kids don't get as badly affected but they should test them. Not so sure how well it would go though considering that the children ain't gonna be cooperative.

=== Author: TheFearlessCow===
When you’re on HQO, you’ll get a video call from MOH 3 times a day and tell them your temperature. If you mention that you have any symptoms, you’ll be sent to the hospital to get tested. Most likely all the kids and parents have a HQO now and are doing that. If no symptoms during this 14 days, then you won’t get tested.

=== Author: smalldog257===
From news reports on this cluster it seems they're only testing people with symptoms and the children haven't been tested.

=== Author: rockymountain05===
Same thoughts. I honestly think it's pretty impossible to have 3 teachers but none of the kids infected in that one preschool centre, given how close the interaction is in a preschool setting. There may well be a few or more kids already infected but asymptomatic.

=== Author: theepicflyer===
I personally think they won't close schools until they close most workspaces. Singapore has many families without grandparents or other caretakers for young children. If they close schools without closing workplaces, there's gonna be a lot of chaos from parents trying to find someone to take care of their kids during the day.

That said, I think they should close all non-essential workplaces, and hence schools, to contain this second wave of local transmission from all the recent imported cases.

=== Author: Burr1t0ad===
I feel in today’s economy, with corona or not, it wouldn’t be wise to be choosy.

=== Author: exprtcar===
Probably to buy time to finalise economic plans/assistance. Keeping the economy afloat for as long as possible until more shutdowns are inevitable. A risky move, sure.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
Yes. A week ago government said no proof  of spread in schools... now they got it.

=== Author: FitCranberry===
the messaging to the public and the actions behind the scenes are always different

=== Author: aham_brahmasmi===
The problem is that many tend to lose their lives during an economic downturn. Remember that during the 2008 financial crisis, there were quite a few (almost around 10,000 people reported) who committed suicide. Losing your job means not being able to provide for yourself and your family and relying on handouts. People then unfortunately infer that they are worthless and see death as a better alternative. 

A lockdown seems to be necessary but if the government does impose one, they need to make sure the people are sheilded from the economic downturn.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
The fears are rational imo. Children are vectors of transmission... they may be asymptotatic, but they still spreading it

=== Author: cxrossfire===
I also wonder too but at the same time all the Sparkletots cases are adults not the kids... Hope the kids are all fine.

=== Author: potatomaster420===
> I understand govt's rationale for keeping schools open

I still don't understand it, could you give an eli5?

=== Author: velvethunder===
>I wonder how it will now assuage the fears of people

By insisting such fears are irrational, shortsighted, and unnecessary.  


Only to close them later cause ""the situation have changed"".

No way. Govt wont do it.

=== Author: vaultofechoes===

Lockdown will affect us very profoundly in different ways.
Even during a lockdown, people from upper class, middle, working and lower class are all affected differently. For many of the working and lower class, the effects of a lockdown will be much more long lasting than having a mild case of covid-19 itself. For eg, getting wages cut or even retrenched, losing more than 50% of its business, unable to find a new job till economy picks up again. These are already happening right now. 

If they are one of the ppl who are working for entertainment venues, chances are they won’t know when is their next pay. Nothing is certain for these groups of people. 

Many research articles have also called out that social distancing measures, contact tracing and conducting swab tests are the key.

Putting a lockdown instantly is only the easy way out. Not to say it is not needed, but it shouldn’t be done rashly.

=== Author: onna_7===
Please think more critically before making such insensitive comments.

I teach in a school.
Not all parents can work from home. >50% of the parents I know in my school are single parents. 

Their income isn’t high in the first place, coupled with the bad economy now - it would be a nightmare if school closes and they have to spend further time and money to look for other options. 

Even for students with nuclear families (parents together), are you absolutely sure a parent can sit by and ensure the student can still learn effectively from home? What about special needs schools? 

If you wanna talk about spreading covid-19 at schools: you should see how many students come in sick lol. The Teachers are at risk themselves but schools have placed much more social distancing rules than any other workplaces or public places out there.

This isn’t weak leadership. If anything, the government has put in due consideration. No plan is perfect and we’re still hoping things improve.

Still, Teachers have to prep for home based learning that could still happen if things escalate. 
The uncertainty sucks but we all have to make do in this situation don’t we 💁🏻‍♀️

=== Author: the99percent1===
The virus is still active in children. Even though the virus isnt life threatening and usually mild for the kids, they are indeed infecting their parents and so on..

=== Author: exprtcar===
The danger is ANY scenario where more active infections occur at the same time. Because it stresses hospitals, test availability and medical supplies. The more that happens, the worse for society

=== Author: evilplushie===
Coworkers. Probably touching a lot of the same surfaces and not washing hands. Especially since it's a preschool

=== Author: tommygecko===
Small kids also not as socially aware. Often see them sneeze/cough without covering mouth. Always scares me a little bit seeing them do this. So I wouldn't be surprised preschool is one of the most infectious places if someone inside gets the virus.

=== Author: woowombat===
Unknown due to lack of data on this virus, but possible. Shutting schools for other infections is proven to be at least partially effective: 

*""There have been a number of studies that have looked at reactive closures. These analyses,* [*including a paper in Nature in 2006 using math models*](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04795)  *\[of an influenza pandemic\], typically find that such reactive school closures for a moderately transmissible pathogen reduces the cumulative infection rate by about 25%""*

=== Author: velvethunder===
The study itself does not recommend school closure though:  
"" However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure""

=== Author: FatAsian3===
Yea, it's either the ineffectiveness of SHN measures, or they are still mingling around with family members and not observing the important hygeine factors.

=== Author: flascholle===
also, it's a single day increase of 35 local cases, out of the 73 cases. As compared to the previous spikes which were mostly imported...

=== Author: avocado_milkshake===
It's honestly very easy, I've seen it in movies. Just pull up the CCTV footage and say ENHANCE and double click the mouse. Repeat a few more times and you can count the number of pores on all their faces!

=== Author: heil_to_trump===
Actually, I seem to be of the opposite opinion. If the number of unlinked cases that cannot be contact traced continues to rise, we should switch from containment to mitigation.

At this stage I think containment is still possible, but if cases continue to rise at this pace, by this time next week we should move to mitigation. If this occurs, contact tracing would be not needed at all

=== Author: UnintelligibleThing===
People who do contact tracing are already employees in the civil service.

=== Author: vaultofechoes===
Yeah it would make sense for her to have to contracted it when she returned to school

=== Author: ryuuheii===
Other infected are staff and family of staff

=== Author: Pandacius===
High chance children mediated the infection. Many children don't display any noticeable symptoms with the virus, but are huge disease carriers.

=== Author: sgdoktor===
The problem is that kids are not exactly your most hygienic: touching their noses and snot and all that. They have a chance to be super spreaders: home -> school -> grandparents house. Reinforcing good hygiene is definitely a must.

=== Author: evilplushie===
Might be their immune systems fought it off. Think out of all the cases so far, we only had one below 10 year old infected and he was on the flight from wuhan

If you havent noticed , the entire region is in total and complete lockdown.. business absolutely grinded to a halt.

Singapore has done extremely well to last this long.. we've been fighting the virus since it started to get serious in China.

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
If they are asymptomatic vectors, they should be positive. Either this virus is really weird and stays away from kids (for the most part) or they haven't tested the kids yet (why tho?)

=== Author: Fellinlovewithawhore===
Problem is kids wont stay at home even if school's cancelled. I wont put it past idiots who see it as an opportunity for their family to go out and shit.

=== Author: chenhankiang===
All adults? So weird

=== Author: quietobserver1===
Is it because of the testing procedure? No fever so no test?

=== Author: Klubeht===
Yea probably not. As others have pointed out, the PCF cluster is not the kids themselves. As long as you don't have an actual school cluster where u have a bunch of students falling sick I doubt schools will be closed. I suspect the local unlinked cases might be more a case of unknown local clusters forming.

=== Author: Eskipony===
They already said that if they were to close schools it would be in tandem with workplace closures. I guess if community transmission becomes frequent they will pull that trigger.

=== Author: Aphelion===
This. It's their last hurrah once it's over. Closing down is really losing face and the future generations which is the current students may lose confidence in...

=== Author: Klubeht===
Yes of course but I think we're kinda beyond that point by now. I'm more curious to know if any of the imported cases have spread locally. The recent cases have come so fast and thick it's hard to keep track.

=== Author: Achro===
I mean, *grown adults* constantly do that.

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
But then why no kids tested positive? Or they didn't test the kids yet?

=== Author: theblahking11===
25% effective is a lot by the way. We have taken a lot of other measures so for us number would be higher

=== Author: riotgrrlbones===
Actually the study recommends a full combination of measures if the end goal is to bring the cases down to lowest possible number quickly before it gets exponential. i.e. Quarantine + 50% workplace closure + school closure for 2 weeks. But of course this doesn't take into account economic impact. 

They do cite workplace closure as higher priority as identified work as a higher-risk area vs schools due to various factors (e.g. adults more likely to be symptomatic, kids more likely to stay home when sick), but have acknowledged kids could be transmitting virus within home community, which our recent cases and overseas situation have proven.

""The location of infection (school, workplace, or home community) was determined according to the site where individuals were exposed to the virus (table). Owing to behaviours of school absenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, the number of infections acquired at work consistently exceeded those at school, although students could be transmitting the virus within the home community.""

At the time of writing their study, SG had 243 cases - this was ~16 March. The global and local situation has evolved rapidly since then. More cases around the world and in SG have shown kids to be a vector, and I think this is something the government is realising and starting to look into.

Strictly speaking, we are on partial lockdown, if you count entertainment venues closing down without a choice/ travel restrictions in place.

I am ok with a full lockdown, but that’s because my job will remain intact. Unfortunately this not so for many others. 😢

A full lockdown also implies all our movement will be monitored (I’m talking about worst case scenarios) I don’t know about you, but I’d like to still walk to the supermarket without a certificate that I’m healthy, or that I have perfect reason to go supermarket lol! 

I agree that we can’t remain complacent. 

But my point is lockdown is not a cure all for Covid-19, results in multiple consequences, hence it shouldn’t be the first choice. 

In the case where lockdown is still needed because people have not complied with social distancing - then of course we have no choice.

=== Author: rowgw===
But those entertainment venues should be more than 2 weeks (I forgot until when it is going to be closed) since they are really legit places to spread.

=== Author: aspaldos===
1. Just because you work from home doesn't mean that you have free time to take care of your kids during working hours. It's called working remotely and not remotely working. 

2. Another word for childcare is school, all you suggested was to maintain school for kids whose parents cannot work from home. So do you close schools or no?

3. Your arguments are trash and you are trash. Go back under your bridge.

=== Author: onna_7===
Let me know how you can do so when some drive Grab? Work in retail? Work in frontlines? Work in F&B places? So if we mandate work from home - they won’t be able to keep an income. Our country does not function like other places where they give out generous welfare packages to employers. (Eg UK - where Boris has said to guarantee 80% of pay) although that would reaaaaaaallly help. 

Next, where do we get the extra staff who will work in childcare to fit in the extra demand then? So schools close but childcare centres are ok?

In other countries where schools shut down in short notice - most of them did not take as stringent measures initially as SG did, and this comes as a shock + whole load of work for teachers who did not have time to prep. Even so, those countries allow home tutoring. This is not new to them. Singapore has never been as strong in this although we have been introducing home based learning gradually. Of course, we can still learn if this is enforced.

The fact that now we have not closed schools yet, and have the time to prep for home based learning - is a luxury. I just hope to point this out that we are doing better than we thought but I agree such measures can be looked into if things get worse. 


Just FYI I’m all for work from home lol! But it requires so much more effort than you think.

=== Author: lmnmss===
Lol but previously masks mia what

=== Author: itsjoetho===
What scares me the most. That even if you self quarantined as soon as you enter, you just have to sneeze and someone walking by is most likely infected too.
It's not the danger of the virus.. But how easy it spreads..

=== Author: TheFearlessCow===
Guaranteed all the kids and their parents will get a House Quarantine Order. If any kids are showing symptoms, they will get tested. This happened to the other preschool that was closed for 2 weeks.

=== Author: the99percent1===
For some reason, kids can fight the virus. 

There is very little deaths and infected kids worldwide. Heck, even that 6 month old baby that was infected in Singapore 2 weeks ago, recovered within a day.

That doesn't mean the virus cant jump over to their parents and start infecting them and worst.. their grandparents.. which the virus is absolutely showing no mercy towards...

=== Author: velvethunder===
Oh I dont disagree with you that the government is slowly waking up to the importance of addressing kids as a vector. It is something mooted as early as February.   


It is just that the researchers are not committed to recommending the entire range of measures. Let's put it this way, the bureaucrat mind is probably going ""Oh, you mean I can choose"" and they chose the one option that allowed them to look after economic and political interests.  


In the end, Asian societies tend to view people as economic assets.

>The economic costs of running at 30% capacity for 3-4 months is far worse than locking down for a few weeks.

For many countries yes but for a country as open as singapore...I'm not so sure. The lack of self sustainability is something that we cannot take for granted and not just in terms of natural resources.

Having said that, I think once all the singaporeans who are coming back home from overseas are back and the cases are still not easing, then I wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of lockdown at some point.

=== Author: Fellinlovewithawhore===
Wuhan is still in somewhat of a lockdown. We're not sure how the situation would be when they have full movement again.

This. My grandma still go coffeeshop to drink coffee etc. I cannot. People are just not taking it seriously. My routines aren't affected much cos I usually go home after work + stay in on weekends even before the corona situation. But I just hope the situation is over soon cos so many people's lives are affected (my dad works in f&b so yea). I hope people can take it seriously, stay home when you are sick, cover your mouth when you cough and stop gathering.

 I had a grab driver who was coughing so badly without a mask the other day and so many in public coughing without covering their mouths. I still see students gathering in groups and loitering around malls. I agree we should still support the f&b and businesses but instead of sitting there to eat, why not dabao? And go home immediately after you got your stuff.

=== Author: gretsall===
I believe a full lockdown is inevitable. Rather than delaying the inevitable, hopefully it can put a stop to local transmission and we can move on with life sooner. There will always be people who don't comply with social distancing. My own workplace is not really implementing anything since it's the busiest period of the year. Unless gov regulates it, people will try their best to stay afloat in this trying time. There's a Chinese saying 長痛不如短痛.. locking movement and waiting it out really seems like the best solution now.

=== Author: mylifeforthehorde===
I'd like to go to the supermarket and movies and what not. But if it means sticking it out and not putting others and myself at risk, it's fine. It's a small sacrifice for us to make in the long run. 

Lockdown isnt a cure..because there is no cure. There is no alternate in the foreseeable future that I can see.

Yup, I agree with you. The study doesn't take into account economic impact. We have to balance the pros and cons. We may see tens of thousands more cases if we don't implement the full range of measures, but may be deemed a better option than shutting things down so soon. End goal is to flatten the curve - scary part is it's an incredibly fine line to walk, as the risk of a serious outbreak spike like Korea is real.

Lmao. Are you actually being serious? 

So kids can don’t go to school, but stay in a childcare for an extended period instead, and not learn anything as useful? Great argument. 

Companies can mandate that, whether they can maintain that and still keep up with KPI is another story. 

Parents who work from home are *working*. So do you expect them to put more kids in a childcare too? Or sacrifice their work to ensure kids learn?

Let me quote another country.
In UK - Oxford University researchers have also just argued that the predicted outcome by Imperial College London (that the Govt followed) has not counted in several factors and predicted death rates may be an exaggeration.
This means that the lockdown in UK might be a mistake as it may be an extremely disproportionate response to the virus. While they are still conducting more tests, if this lockdown is a mistake - It just cost them 350 billion pounds.


The whole point of not going into a lockdown rashly is to minimise all of these disruptions to folks from all kinds of background and economic losses that we might take years to recover from.

I’ve established plenty that to insist on a lockdown recklessly is selfish, limiting and stupid. 
It should only be done when we have no choice but to give up our personal freedom to fight this spread. 
Up to you to digest.

I think what they meant was you are supposed to stay home immediately, but the 14 day duration only starts counting the next day (i.e. you're not supposed to count the day you touch down as day 1).

But that guy took it as a 1 day free pass to be stupid.

=== Author: zeroX14===
Security industry can just mean security guard. Normal to move from employer to employer.

=== Author: stikskele===
He’s not the first person I’ve seen this explanation from though. Calling touchdown Day 0 and telling people that monitoring starts from Day 1 just leaves people to fill in the blank themselves that their “14 days” starts from the day after they touchdown, rather than the fact that it includes Day 0.

Unfortunately plenty of people have no initiative when things are ambiguous, so it has to be made very clear to people that they have to go straight home, no passing go or collecting $200. Perhaps even to the point of escorting them directly to taxis willing to take those on SHN, with the driver’s particulars taken down for potential contact tracing.

=== Author: dodgethis_sg===
To be fair, he gave that answer almost immediately when his friends questioned him on the original post.

=== Author: dothisnowww===
How did you find out? And anything done to make her go home?

=== Author: kel007===
7D5N tour sounds better and longer than a 5D4N tour, so day of departure and day of return becomes one day each.

Start from Day 0 because army never teach u is it /s

=== Author: autonomy_girl===
Agree. While it is true that common sense tells you that it should start immediately, common sense isn't actually very common. Calling it Day 1 removes any ambiguity.

=== Author: etca2z===
Any responsible person would just self quarantine immediately and not bother with “which day should I start?”. Day 0, Day 1 counting is supposed to let you know when you’re clear. The guy is probably full of Bak Kut Teh in his brain, or just plain selfish.

=== Author: Taellion===
Lol, why is he playing the victim?

=== Author: iamweird999===
Please. Touchdown is day zero. We specifically told them that SHN starts upon touchdown. This stupid idiot anyhow one. We start monitoring them from day one but doesn't mean they can anyhow go out. On day 15 then they are free.

=== Author: dothisnowww===

When in wrong, blame others, not yourself, right?

=== Author: KampongFish===
Y'all joking, but this is the same kind of logic kids follow when they rout learn math by applying formula only. Bodoh straywire way of applying rules. 

ICA officer say SHN starts when you are at home means start once you reach home. Dont need think about context, apply instructions can already.

=== Author: LeviAEthan512===
Who the fuck thinks that? The rule is proven to be 5 seconds by science

=== Author: skipshentaiscenes===
Cool, it still does not make sense to roam free for 1 full day before the 2 weeks quarantine though, unless he is really that robotic and is not aware of the situation.

=== Author: hehe6===
basically what's happening is that ICA is giving really bad instructions to people who aren't interested in serving their SHN diligently. i'm currently under SHN and we have been issued a form that literally states that SHN begins on the day you enter Singapore. however it is counted as Day 0, and SHN lapses at Day 14. why they couldn't just call it Day 1 and make the last day Day 15, beats me. but i'm assuming everyone just thinks 'lol day 0 not counted xddd' and goes out to enjoy one last time before getting quarantined.

=== Author: QzSG===
The instructions basically mean your shn starts immediately, of which once u stay at home until the next day, that's day 1.

I think the instructions he was given was clear but it didn’t go so detailed because they assume people like this Alan is not such a dumb fuck. And coupled with the fact that we Singaporeans have the tendency to use the “you say one ah” excuse and act blur.

> # COVID-19 Budget: Singapore allocating additional $48 billion to combat ‘unprecedented crisis’

> SINGAPORE — The Singapore government will allocate over $48 billion to combat the “unprecedented” COVID-19 crisis, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in his Ministerial Statement delivered in Parliament on Thursday (26 March). 

> Dubbed the Resilience Budget, the sum comes on top of the $6.4 billion Unity Budget announced by Heng in February that was meant to alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic.

> “Altogether, we are dedicating close to $55 billion to support people in this battle, amounting to 11 per cent of our (gross domestic product). This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation,” said Heng.

> He added that the government has received President Halimah Yacob’s in-principle approval to draw up to $17 billion from Singapore’s past reserves to fund part of the Resilience Budget.

> The goals of the latest supplementary Budget are threefold: to save jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods; to help enterprises overcome intermediate challenges; and to strengthen the nation’s economic and social resilience.

> As of Thursday morning, the Ministry of Trade and Industry had further downgraded Singapore’s 2020 GDP forecast from a range of between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 percent, to between -4 per cent and -1 per cent.

> Based on advanced GDP estimates, Singapore’s economy in the first quarter saw a 10.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter contraction, or 2.2 per cent year-on-year. This reversed the 0.6 per cent growth seen in the previous quarter.

> Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic will take “at least a year to resolve”, Heng pointed out that broad swathes of the economy have been hurt – with the worst-affected being Singapore’s aviation and tourism sectors.

> Prior to Heng’s speech, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin read a speech from President Halimah, in which Singapore has only had to tap on its past reserves once: in 2009, amid the global financial crisis. At that time, then President S R Nathan approved a draw of $4.9 billion to fund relief measures.

> # Singapore Government pumps in $48b more to fight Covid-19 fallout, on top of $6.4b already announced

> SINGAPORE - The Government is setting aside a further $48.4 billion to support businesses, workers and families, as Singapore grapples with an unprecedented crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

> This comes on top of the $6.4 billion in measures that it announced just over a month ago to cushion the fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak.

> In all, Singapore is dedicating nearly $55 billion to combat the coronavirus - about 11 per cent of its GDP, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Thursday (March 26) when he unveiled the Supplementary Budget.

> Mr Heng told the House: ""This is a landmark package, and a necessary response to a unique situation.""

> The additional $48 billion amounts to nearly half of the Government's $106 billion Budget for 2020.

> It is also more than double the $20.5 billion Resilience Package announced in the 2009 Budget to tackle the global financial crisis.

> Describing the coronavirus pandemic as an ""unprecedented crisis of a highly complex nature"", Mr Heng said: ""In economic terms alone, this will likely be the worst economic contraction since independence.""

> ""This extraordinary situation calls for extraordinary measures,"" he added.

> Mr Heng noted that the coronavirus outbreak has impacted broad swathes of Singapore's economy, with the aviation and tourism sectors worst hit.

> He said international visitor arrivals have nearly ground to a halt.

> Consumer-facing sectors such as food services, retail trade and land transport have been significantly affected, he said.

> As external demand falls and supply chains get disrupted, outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesade trade have also been hit, he added.

> Mr Heng spoke after Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin said President Halimah Yacob has given her in-principle support for the Government's proposal to draw on its past reserves.

> Delivering the President's message on her behalf, Mr Tan said the second support package to tackle Covid-19 is a substantial one that exceeds the current reserves accumulated in this term of government.

> ""Our reserves were built up over the years through prudent spending, and were set aside precisely to cater for rainy days. The situation we are heading into looks more like a thunderstorm and not just a drizzle.""

> Advance GDP estimates released on Thursday morning show Singapore's economy shrank 2.2 per cent in the first quarter.

> The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its 2020 growth forecast to a range of -4.0 to -1.0 per cent this year, from an earlier estimate of -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.

> The last time Singapore registered a full-year contraction of its economy was in 2001 during the Dot.com Bust when growth fell by 1 per cent.

> Setting out the grim economic outlook worldwide, Mr Heng said the global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock.

> On the supply side, locked down workers are unable to work, and a disruption in any one country will have knock-on effects worldwide as global supply chains are highly integrated.

> Demand has fallen as people stay home and stop spending, he noted.

> The International Monetary Fund expects a recession that will at minimum rival the one during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, while financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties, he said.

> As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by global financial shocks, he added.

> The deputy prime minister recounted how there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China just five weeks ago, when he presented Budget 2020 on Feb 18.

> The outbreak has escalated quickly since, and the World Health Organization now estimates that there are more 410,000 cases across more than 190 countries.

> On the medical front, many countries have implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus so their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, he said.

> ""In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe,"" he said.

> The country has stepped up its measures as the outbreak worsened worldwide, he noted.

> However, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions will last even longer, Mr Heng said.

> ""The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections. We must be prepared to take further, tougher measures.""

> Covid-19, Mr Heng said, is a defining challenge for Singapore - one that will test its social cohesion and pyschological resilience.

> ""The Government will take all the social and economic measures we need to keep our people safe, keep our economy running, and prepare ourselves for the recovery.

> ""Now, more than ever, we need Singaporeans to be strong, and ride through these challenges together.""

> He said he named this Supplementary Budget the ""Resilience Budget"", to reflect the country's determination to remain resilient in the face of these challenges.

> ""Come what may, no matter how daunting the challenge at hand, we will bounce back, stronger and more united than ever, as we weather this storm together,"" he said.

> SINGAPORE: Those who breach stay-home notices issued to curb the COVID-19 pandemic will be charged in court, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 25).

> ""I have given very clear instructions,"" he said. ""Where these cases (of breaches) are verified to be true, we will charge in court.""

> Mr Shanmugam's comments are the latest indication that authorities are ready to get tough with those who do not abide by the notices, which have been issued to all travellers entering Singapore since Mar 22.

> 

> These people are required to remain at home at all times for 14 days as a precautionary measure to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission in Singapore.

> 

> But Mr Shanmugam said he has seen recent reports of returning travellers, particularly from the United Kingdom, going out to eat local food, holding birthday parties at home, interacting with friends and visiting clubs and bars.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""Many Singaporeans get upset when they hear about this,"" he said.

> Another case, Mr Shanmugam said, involved a Singaporean returning from Myanmar and going out for bak kut teh despite having been given a stay-home notice. The man also posted about it on his Facebook page.

> ""I have asked for that case to be investigated,"" Mr Shanmugam said.

> 

> ""We are trying to verify some of these messages of stay-home notices being flouted. And if anyone, members of public, you have information about such behaviour, please give it to the police. We will follow up, and we cannot allow such behaviour.""

> 

> The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has issued more than 21,000 stay-home notices to date, and has enforced them through means like text messages, calls and surprise visits.

> Those who fail to comply face prosecution under Section 21A of the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA) and may be fined up to S$10,000, jailed up to six months or both.

> 

> Other penalties include revoking or shortening the validity of a person's permanent residency status, long-term visit pass, dependent's pass, student's pass or work pass.

> ""MOH (Ministry of Health) will be setting out new regulations under the IDA,"" Mr Shanmugam said.

> Those who falsely declare their travel history to avoid being issued with stay-home notices may also be prosecuted under the law, said the minister.

> 

> This includes Section 182 of the Penal Code and Section 57(1)(g) of the Immigration Act, both of which carry jail terms and/or fines.

> ""There is a wider duty that each of us owes to control the spread of COVID-19, and really not to endanger others and expose them to infection,"" he stated.

> 

> The minister revealed that authorities are trying to verify reports of a person who had gone for a holiday in Italy, developed COVID-19 symptoms but hid his symptoms and travel history to get on a plane to return to Singapore.

> ""Later in Singapore, he was admitted to hospital, found very ill and to be carrying the virus,"" he said.

> ""If this is true, the conduct is highly irresponsible. If we knew that there was a significant risk that he was infected, but kept silent and went on the flight. then he did so knowing that others could be infected.""

> Mr Shanmugan said he understands that Singaporeans could be anxious to come home to be with their family and have access to the healthcare, but this should not be at the ""risk of endangering other people's well-being"".

> ""(The person) should have declared his symptoms at check-in,"" he said. ""Then the airline will make a considered decision further to allow the person to fly and if so with what sort of precautions.""

> Mr Shanmugam said he also received feedback from healthcare workers that some were not truthful about their travel history when they went to consult doctors.

> To overcome this, he pointed to ICA's announcement that all travellers entering Singapore from Mar 27 will have to fill in an electronic health declaration so authorities will know if they have travelled to a high-risk country.

> 

> ""The Government has put in place strict regulations and a strong enforcement network,"" he stated.

> ""But regulation and strong enforcement are not going to be enough on their own if people continue to insist on being irresponsible. All Singaporeans have to do our part.""

In the case of Italy, it's part of the common travel area of the EU, so there are no border checks in each individual country. Effectively you only get a stamp on arrival into the Schengen area and a stamp on departure - they will specify which country you arrive into/leave from but that's it.

Here, if you're so eager to see it firsthand: any r/worldnews post about Sg and sort by controversial. 

Usually when people truly want to ascertain if something is true, they try to search things up themselves first...

Just link me and u/throwaway5849769 to one thread or comment and we will be satisfied. Why is that so difficult to do?

=== Author: raspberrih===
If you want to see it so badly why don't you actually go look at it? I've told you exactly where to find those comments, do you really need to demand exact links? I literally just went on and saw those comments, I don't see why it's so difficult for you.

Don't act like you're talking about this in good faith when you refuse to look at the evidence people provide for you. In the first place it was never something that needed evidence to supplement, just logic and experience.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
That's a lot of words for something you can't/won't provide. Just link one comment and this discussion will be over, in good faith. C'mon?

=== Author: raspberrih===
Dude I'm done with you entitled people acting like you're so intent on seeing those comments, but refusing to go look at them once I tell you where there's tons of them.

You want to be spoonfed? Okay. But I won't be the one to do it.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
This is not about being ""entitled"" or wanting to be ""spoonfed"".

Your original assertion, I quote, is:

>Bro trust me, they *are* making **tons** of uninformed comments about Sg. I'm glad you haven't seen them, but **I've seen a ton**

And mind you, this assertion was made specifically in the context of Singapore's supposedly-draconian Covid-19 policies (just in case you try to shift the goalpost and talk about ""general"" comments about how Singapore has draconian laws like section 377A)

Now, at least 3 posters: myself,  [u/throwaway5849769](https://www.reddit.com/u/throwaway5849769/) and u/fallenspaceman have asked you to provide some links to such comments.

Now, could you please show us these ""tons of uninformed comments"" so that we can conclude this discussion, in good faith?

=== Author: raspberrih===
I have told you exactly where to find them. Perhaps you are, for some strange reason, unable to use anything other than direct links. If so, too bad. I wish you the best.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
Thank you for conceding that you can't provide the examples.

I've told you where to look. But you won't look. And you're here saying I haven't provided evidence.

Did you read that article properly? It said that they plan to submit it for approval in a months' time. Also, it's not clear what kind of equipment is needed, and whether it's something common/easy that every clinic can obtain, or whether they need to ramp up manufacturing of that equipment too. And whether the test works straight on a swab, or if it's like most other kits out there, you need to perform RNA extraction, which can be the bottleneck.

Nowadays research labs will do shining press releases at a very early stage, and the press is kinda in cahoots as it boosts the reputation of Singapore.

=== Author: cst-rdt===
Andrew Cuomo is the governor of one of the most critically important states in America and has a population of millions of people who are anxious, scared, and looking to him for leadership. He's doing what he needs to be doing to breed calm and confidence.

=== Author: magneticanisotropy===
I'm not sure Cuomo is wrong here though.   He was referring to NYC, iirc, and NY state has a population of about 20 million, with a bit over 103k tests so far.  This means for the state, their is over 5k/million people.  But most of these tests go to the city with 8 million people, and I'd guess this takes NYC to higher than SKs or Singapore's numbers?

I agree; the MTA in particular is an abomination, and I would rather eat an uncooked monitor lizard than support him for a higher office.

That said, this is a singular moment in history. He's seen it, seized it, and is stepping up at precisely the time people need him to - which is a lot more than can be said for other governors around the country (I'm looking at you, Ron DeSantis.)

> # Sparkletots preschool Covid-19 cluster not teacher’s fault: MP Cheryl Chan

> The fight against the Covid-19 outbreak is not a blame game, Member of Parliament (MP) for Fengshan Cheryl Chan said in a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mar. 25.

> Not a time to point fingers

> Ever since the first Covid-19 case was reported at PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots @ Fengshan Blk 126, there had been “many comments on the teacher, PCF, MOE (Ministry of Education) etc”, said Chan.

> The preschool is located at 126 Bedok North Street 2.

> Chan clarified that the first teacher (Case 516) who tested positive for Covid-19 “did not travel overseas nor have any family members who contracted it”.

> Neither did the teacher display any symptoms when she was in school, Chan added.

> In a subsequent update on Thursday, Mar. 26, Chan said the preschool’s principal and all staff who tested positive for Covid-19 have been quarantined at “dedicated facilities” since Mar. 24.

> Also, teachers who attended a course with the principal have been placed under home quarantine, she said.

> 19 cases reported at Fengshan PCF Sparkletots centre cluster

> Out of the 73 new cases reported on Wednesday, Mar. 25, 16 are linked to the PCF Sparkletots @ Fengshan.

> And on Thursday, Mar. 26, another teacher was confirmed to have tested positive for Covid-19

> This brings the total number of cases linked to the new cluster to 19.

> Currently, 15 of the cases at the centre are preschool staff (including its principal), while four are family members of an infected staff (Case 601).

> Chan also clarified in her post that Case 601 is not the first teacher who tested positive on Mar. 23.

> Closing of PCF centres the right thing to do

> Closing the centre to prevent to prevent any further spread in the community is the “right thing to do in the interest of the children and the community”, Chan said.

> She also stressed that all PCF childcare centres take “necessary precautionary measures” in terms of safety and hygiene especially when dealing with young children.

> No teacher would knowingly do anything that puts the children at risk

> Chan defended the centre’s teachers, adding that none of them would knowingly do things that put the children at risk:

> “The parents of the centre should know the teachers well by now and I trust they have seen how the teachers have been caring and nurturing their young ones.”

> She reiterated that the cluster of infection happened through no fault of the teacher (Case 516), since she was also infected.

> She further clarified that this teacher contracted the virus unknowingly.

> Chan then encouraged parents to monitor their children’s health in the coming days, adding that staff will be calling twice daily to check in on the children too.

> She ended her post by calling on people to continue the fight against Covid-19:

> “We need all hands on deck. Those who are on Stay-Home Notice and Quarantine Order, please spare a thought for others, stay in and be responsible.”

Probably a business decision as well. If they become a cluster, the disinfection fee + reputation damage would be nothing compared to half a night of profit.

Or maybe they didn't receive many bookings at all and decided it'll be unprofitable to operate.

> # COVID-19: Clubs ditch promotions, call off 'farewell' parties on final night before closures take effect

> SINGAPORE: Some clubs which had planned to hold promotional events on the night before their venues are slated to close have decided against such moves, they told CNA on Wednesday (Mar 25).

> 

> This follows an announcement made on Tuesday (Mar 24) that gatherings outside school and work will be limited to a maximum of 10 people from Thursday at 11.59pm to Apr 30 this year, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force had said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In addition, the task force said in a statement that it all entertainment venues must close, such as night clubs, discos, karaoke outlets, cinemas and theatres where it said there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time.

> 

> Speaking to CNA, Magic Carpet Lounge managing director Mr Sanjay Rekhi said that the club will close one day early and call off a promotion on Wednesday night. The promotion originally involved a free cover charge and a buy one get one free bottle promotion.

> “We discussed within the club stakeholders, and the collective opinion was that it was best to be prudent and safe,” he told CNA. “We understand some of our customers may not be happy about the cancellation but at least they will be be safe.”

>

> Magic Carpet Lounge had already implemented a host of precautionary measures prior to the Government announcement to limit events to 250 participants, said Mr Sanjay. This included keeping the club “exclusive” to the first 100 guests, temperature screenings, as well as the recording of customers' details.

> ""As a business owner, I would rather be safe than sorry. Financial losses can be recovered - lives cannot be,” said Mr Sanjay. “We had started restricting our club entry to 100, we are a 4,300 square feet venue. Based on Singapore’s new policy, we are allowed 150 or 200 people in the club. But we have started restricting ourselves to the first 100 people to come into the club as early as two weeks ago.”

> 

> However, Mr Sanjay pointed out that clubs such as his need more help from landlords especially given the current economic situation.

> “We are also hoping with this government announcement of a shutdown, there is a way that we can go back … to our landlord and say that can this be termed as something like a force majeure, an act of God … and they could let us not pay rent.

> ""Because if not, we are going to go out of business. Before this virus thing is done, we will be done.”

> Cherry Discotheque's ""It was nice knowing you farewell party"" has also been called off, it told CNA.

> Other clubs holding special promotions on Wednesday night included Club Lux's ""The Last Supper"". The club did not reply to CNA's requests for comment and it is unclear if the event will proceed as planned.

> Club Lux's ""The Last Supper"" promotion. (Photo: Club Lux Facebook)

> ​​​​​​​

> Earlier on Wednesday, a joint-statement by the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force emphasised that nightlife operators must continue to “strictly implement” safe distancing measures.

> “We are aware a number of nightlife operators intend to host “farewell” events tonight that could result in large numbers of people congregating,” the joint-statement said.

> “The Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further.”

> These safe distancing measures involve the suspending of events with 250 or more participants, as well as the implementation of safety measures for events with fewer than 250 participants such as reducing mingling amongst participants.

> “These safe distancing measures are enforceable. Officers from government agencies including the Singapore Police Force will be on the ground to monitor the situation and carry out enforcement action over the next two days,” said the statement.

> “During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic.”

All those hardcore clubbers suddenly had a change of mind and decided not to club on the last night before shutdowns? Who you kidding bro

=== Author: realdatanub===
Not all measures are released with advance notice - property cooling measures are a good example. The intent is typically to prevent a regulatory arbitrage of sorts, which would run counterintuitive to the policy measure's intent. 

When dealing with corporates however, things are not that clear cut, especially for this Covid-19 situation  where policymakers have to balance between social/health and economic impact. 

IMO, advance notice in this case, is warranted and appropriate so long as there are other measures in place to prevent unintended consequences. In this case, they have made it clear that clubs that continue host events above the pax limit, or fail to adopt social distancing practices will be penalised.

=== Author: DasBiceps===
Exactly. If Mr Sanjay had come out and openly admitted he was wrong for even thinking of holding the 'farewell party' to begin with, then fair enough. But instead he acts as if he suddenly has his customers' well-being in mind:

>“We understand some of our customers may not be happy about the cancellation but at least they will be be safe.”

Why is it only that drastic measures have to be taken when the top gets it?

=== Author: troublesome58===
PAP wan sui!

=== Author: tenbre===
That escalated quickly. 
Imagine calling up all your parents overnight. Woah.
Definitely going to have many parents and kids turning up in the morning, getting told to go home, and entire day work plans gone

=== Author: rekabre===
Yeah. Stuff like this should come with built-in childcare leave (not from the usual quota) that either parent can tap on and employer must comply with no questions asked. If not some will have no choice but to bring their kids to office...

=== Author: greenerapple===
So the principal's case was only discovered after the teacher's case was reported on Monday? Even though the principal's symptoms appeared first on Tuesday.

=== Author: etyn100===
There are more taichi behind the scenes. Some are in red zone financially.

=== Author: Player748===
Mild symptoms, just rest and recover at home. Why need to fire?

May be promotion waiting. So hardworking. Didn't geng MC.

=== Author: etyn100===
OP loves to ruin people's ricebowl. If anyone is fired from this, it would be called upper management abuse scapegoat. Top government said mild symptoms no need to test.

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
Bloody hell, it looks like the principal was the index case, not that N2 teacher who was discovered first.

=== Author: TheFearlessCow===
I hope so

=== Author: velvethunder===
That would be a massive kneejerk reaction in any plausible context except North Korea.

=== Author: tehtf===
Yes. And ppl question why not closing school. Like gov say close school may as well close work too. But even so need to prepare temp childcare venue  for healthcare/essential service workers while they still maintaining basic operation of society

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
Luckily, the media serial interval is estimated to be around 4 days. So on average, if principal spread to staff on Tuesday (17th), staff became infectious on Saturday. But some kids could have been infected on either Friday or Monday, before the school was closed this Tuesday. I can only hope that even if some of these kids have been infected, their families have been taking some precautions before the kids themselves became infectious. And for heaven's sake, I hope those who have been in contact with these kids stop going out, SHN for the whole family! Otherwise really gg.

=== Author: velvethunder===
And hola, any kid with it will pass to the rest of the office.

=== Author: tenbre===
Damn irresponsible. Entire family already infected. How many days incubating already

=== Author: tenbre===
Will school fees get refunded

She saw the doc on weds, but wasn't pulled for covid testing. That can't be blamed on her.

> # S’pore took Trump’s Covid-19 guidelines leading to ‘very few’ infections, US health official says

> Singapore took United States President Donald Trump’s guidelines on tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, U.S. health official Deborah Birx said.

> Singapore implemented Trump’s guidelines quickly as China’s next door

> Speaking at a virtual town hall hosted by Fox News on Tuesday, March 24 (Singapore time Wednesday, March 25), the White House Covid-19 response coordinator said Singapore executed Trump’s guidelines on the public health crisis “very early because they could see China next door”.

> Dr. Birx works in some weird praise of Trump in her remarks about why Singapore has been relatively successful in fighting off coronavirus: ""They took the president's recommendations and implemented them very early."" pic.twitter.com/RZ64yQUXeL — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 24, 2020

> She was responding to a question from Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer about a headline suggesting a possible second wave in Singapore.

> She continued saying as “so few people have been infected” in Singapore, the country does not have “herd immunity”.

> Birx added that it will be “in everybody’s best interest” to do as Trump recommended, such as working on additional vaccines and therapeutics.

> Trump’s coronavirus guidelines

> Trump’s “Coronavirus Guidelines for America”, issued on March 16, include advice such as staying home should one feel sick, and avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.

> Contradicting his own guidelines

> During his appearance, Trump had said he would love to have businesses open by Easter, which is going to be on April 12.

> Although social distancing was recommended in his guidelines, he had insisted that the measure be relaxed, and that people should go back to work.

> He said at a news conference on Monday, March 23, that “America will again — and soon — be open for business.”

> This is in spite of public health experts warning that ending social distancing prematurely would lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases, which might in turn burden health facilities.

> Downplaying the Covid-19 outbreak

> Attempting to downplay the virus, he had also compared the situation to other relatively more common misfortunes such as the flu or car accidents.

> He said in his first public comments on the virus on Jan. 22 that he was not worried at all, and later dismissed alarm raised over the viral outbreak as a “new hoax” by the Democrats.

> Trump has been widely criticised for his unprepared approach to the Covid-19 outbreak, such as being slow to respond to the growing shortage of medical supplies and testing kits.

> He had blamed the former Obama administration for the lack of testing kits, and said on March 13 that he does not take responsibility for the testing debacle.

Those clubs that are planning the farewell parties should have their license terminated. Where are their social responsibilities? Fully understand that they're doing business and they can't afford to close for an entire month. BUT these clubs are doing promotions and trying to entice MORE people than the usual crowd to patronize them which in my personal opinion is wrong.

=== Author: kccube===
Too late.  Party is on sadly. I predict today and tml will really be party like its 1998. The govt should have just imposed immediate lockdown and not give professor an excuse for farewell party.  

Even before lockdown there are people partying and clubbing already. When they impose a deadline, what were they expecting? People will party even harder till the deadline.

> # COVID-19: Singapore authorities warn against farewell parties at nightspots following closure announcement

> SINGAPORE — The authorities are warning nightlife operators against holding farewell parties following news that a number might be holding them ahead of their closure on Thursday (26 March) night.

> The plans by some of the nightlife operators come after the government announced on Tuesday that all entertainment venues, including clubs, pubs, cinemas, and karaoke outlets, will be closed from Thursday night 11.59pm, until 30 April or later.

> In a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force said that they were aware that a number of entertainment venues might be holding farewell events that could result in large numbers of people congregating.

> “The Multi-Ministry Taskforce’s decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further,” the statement said.

> It added that even before the stricter measures kicked in, nightlife operators were required to implement safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health on 20 March.

> These include suspending events with 250 or more participants. Events with fewer than 250 participants are required to implement necessary precautionary measures, including ensuring a distance of at least a metre between all participants to reduce mingling among participants.

> Officers from government agencies, including the police, will be enforcing these measures on the ground over the next two days, the statement added.

> The Traffic Police will also be conducting island-wide enforcement operations against drink-driving.

> “During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic,” said the authorities.

> The stricter measures were announced during a multi-ministry taskforce press conference on Tuesday. In addition to the closure of entertainment venues, all events, regardless of size, must also be deferred or cancelled, while gatherings outside of work and school are to be limited to 10 people or fewer at any time.

> Retail malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open but only with precautionary measures in place, including reducing operating capacity within each venue, dispersing congregations, and providing digital alternatives to queuing or waiting.

Best not to go out. You're not quarantined yet if you haven't received the notice but for the safety of others,  best not to go out

Test result supposed to take 6 hrs iirc

=== Author: ShiningAway===
I need an update on this, worried for you guys

=== Author: junnir===
I took the test at the start of the month after I came back to SG (didn’t have any symptoms except slight shortness of breath, which was probably due to my dormant asthma), and though Google told me it would take about 6h, NCID said they would need a few days before they can call me to let me know. They called me after 2 days iirc. Not sure if they might need longer now considering that they’re probably testing more people.

Hope you and your family will be fine. Hang in there!

=== Author: chocopinkie===
should be quarantine after confirmed.

=== Author: evilplushie===
No chance of shn if living under same roof. Its going to be quarantine

=== Author: junnir===
I think test results duration varies? I heard it was 6h too but when I went to get tested (as a precaution/‘just in case’) NCID said they will need a few days to get back to me. Iirc it was 2 days before they called me to let me know. I was on SHN the whole time.

=== Author: wantonn00dles===
i have my fingers crossed 😞🤞🏼

=== Author: gostudylahh===
o rly ? now im hoping my family will be safe :3

=== Author: wantonn00dles===
sorry but what's the difference between SHN and quarantine hahaha; I always thought both means to stay at home

=== Author: evilplushie===
Could be backlog

=== Author: DoodPare===
Usually they say expect 3 days before the results, but if positive they will inform asap.

=== Author: oofmewho===
SHN means you can stay in your home, e.g. walk around in other rooms, have contact with your family, etc. But quarantine means that you aren't supposed to even leave the room that you are quarantined in and all your meals will have to be taken inside the room. If your house is not suitable, you will be quarantined at one of the GQFs. Stay safe and stay home!

=== Author: Klubeht===
Stay in room with toilet at all times vs can move about at home. Unless everyone in ur home also under quarantine then no diff probably

=== Author: TheFearlessCow===
Quarantine means you were a close contact of a confirmed case

=== Author: junnir===
Mm. My result came back negative in the end too so maybe they were attending to the positives first. Either way remaining in quarantine while waiting for results is a must!

=== Author: wantonn00dles===
but are both SHN and quarantine the same 14 days??

=== Author: entrydenied===
Even if your family needs to be quarantined they would still separate you so that you don't pass the virus to one and another. So I suspect regular HDB flats can only quarantine 1 to 2 person.

=== Author: hanksredditname===
Seems likely that they also prioritize analysis order. If you were low risk, they did the lab work when they had time. Versus high risk comes in and they do the lab work asap.

It sums up where we are right now. The government is doing its best to keep things under control - and some people and institutions still refuse to take things seriously. From the Karaoke event at Safra, to that rock climber who visited the rock climbing wall while sick- and now this. People never learn ; and this is why the government will have to take increasingly stricter measures. 

I have an elderly dad in hospital, and an elderly mum at home. And I worry about them day and night - that they will be protected from this virus.

But sure. Go for your 1-1 ladies night farewell party or whatever.

Infuriating.

It boggles my mind how people are cavalier about this. We have seen many on social media boasting about breaking their SHN after returning from their travels. 

One was spotted enjoying ‘local delicacies’ at Kampung Admiralty (which is generally touted as a retirement village i.e. where the old people live) and many others happily documenting their clubbing escapades. Both are high risk areas with the potential to spiral out of control. And now the clubs are having ‘farewell parties’ which will only attract more of these people. 

If only we weren’t a complacent bunch.

Seriously felt that closures of clubs etc should have done with immediate effect. Not sure why to give timeline, there wasn't anything to prepare for anyone.  
Travel and SHN notices are given notices for implementation and for people to cancel their plans but entertainment things should be done with immediate effect.


Imagine announcing a full lockdown from tomorrow night, it will create chaos and panic buying and half the Singapore would be out buying and increasing chances of transmission of virus.

Sometimes, I think the gov has the right to believe that its people will be better. There's an invisible enemy out there being a very visible threat.

=== Author: zkng===
They are giving smaller businesses the chance to plan and prepare their contingencies, and meanwhile these clubs created the problem in the first place and are just escalating the problem. Inconsiderate as fuck to people who work in these industries at the lowest levels.

Governments hardly announce anything with immediate effect, probably to give time to update law enforcement agencies. Singapore is not an exception. Lockdowns in US States and New Zealand have been coming into effect with 2 days notice. I see no reason for blame here.

=== Author: Arcturion===
No. If the government makes snap announcements that are effective immediately, the population will expect they will not be given time to react or prepare, and will behave accordingly. 

People will panic every time they *think* the government is going to make an announcement. If you think the panic buying now is bad, wait till you see people panic buying every time there is a rumor the government is going to make an announcement.

=== Author: sherbro===
Well every post counts. Here's where social media can actually do something positive - create enough bad press to make a difference.

Magic Carpet Lounge seems to have shut down their IG and cancelled the event, so it's possible to pressure the others to do so as well.

=== Author: belmont_lay===
> Magic Carpet Lounge seems to have shut down their IG

nope I can still see the IG

they only have 1k followers anyway. and their latest update says they're closed until further notice, which I guess is because of the latest warning about ""farewell parties"" from the govt

ps. if any of the businesses were bothered about the comments, they'd just disable them imo. If they do cancel it'll probably be because of the govt warning.

=== Author: sherbro===
Not sure but I guess it worked. Canvas Singapore seems to have just cancelled as well. Well done...

=== Author: belmont_lay===
you under 18 is it? their IG profile is restricted, ie. adults only.

seriously tho, if govt issue warning they won't play one, they don't dare lose their license.

> # ‘Only at the beginning of a very long fight’: Lawrence Wong says Singapore will continue to review COVID-19 measures

> SINGAPORE: Singapore is “only at the beginning of a very long fight” against COVID-19, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Mar 25) as he warned that the outbreak could continue for “many more months until the end of the year and perhaps even beyond”.

> 

> In an update on the Government’s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak here, Mr Wong outlined how the country has ramped up its measures over the past weeks. These will be kept under constant review with Singapore now at a “critical phase” in its fight against the disease, he said.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> After experiencing an initial wave of imported cases from China, Singapore is now facing a second and much bigger wave of imported cases from the rest of the world, especially from the United States and Europe.

> This reflects the speed at which the virus is spreading outside of China and around the world, Mr Wong told the House.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He added that there is no telling how long this current wave of returnees and imported cases will last as more Singaporeans may want to return home with lockdowns being announced by more countries.

> 

> Singapore now has 38,000 people serving out stay-home notices and the numbers will grow with the rising number of returnees, he said.

> To respond to the new challenge, Mr Wong noted that Singapore has been rapidly adjusting and updating its measures.

> These include tightening border controls, with the latest being announced last week to disallow short-term visitors from entering or transiting in Singapore, as well as limiting returning work pass holders to those providing essential services like healthcare and transport.

> 

> The minister described this as “very significant moves” for a small and open economy like Singapore. “But this is an unprecedented crisis, and we had to move decisively to keep our borders safe,” he said.

> 

> Tourists tagging their luggage at the self service kiosk in Changi Airport Terminal 1 (Photo: Jeremy Long)

> While preparing for more returnees and more imported cases, the Government also does not want Singaporeans to be travelling abroad at this time to avoid adding to a third or fourth wave of imported cases, he said.

> 

> Hence, the country raised its travel advisory to the highest level last week, urging Singaporeans to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect.

> 

> It was also announced on Tuesday that those who insist on travelling will have to pay the full costs of hospital charges if they are admitted for COVID-19-related treatments.

> MEASURES UNDER ""CONSTANT REVIEW""

> When it comes to preventing local transmission, Mr Wong said it remains critical to quickly identify and isolate confirmed cases and their close contacts through contact tracing and quarantine.

> As of Tuesday night, there were around 2,500 persons under quarantine, be it at home or Government quarantine facilities, he told the House, while adding that authorities will continue with “tough enforcement” for both quarantine cases and those issued with stay-home notices.

> 

> The Government is also concerned about the number of locally transmitted cases, especially the ones that are unlinked. Given that the country is seeing more of such cases, a whole range of additional public health measures to slow down the spread of the virus, he said.

> These are applied at different levels, the minister continued. For instance, there are baseline measures, such as daily temperature taking, refraining from shaking hands and practices to uphold personal hygiene which should be continued for a sustained period.

> Beyond that, safe distancing measures which serve as “extra brakes” to help slow down the spread, have been introduced.

> 

> The first set, announced last Friday, suspended all activities for seniors, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants, as well as requiring public venue operators to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons.

> 

> While these measures have brought about some changes, such as fewer crowded venues and alternate seats marked in dining venues, the country “will have to move faster”.

> 

> Safe distancing measures are seen at a Toast Box outlet in Chinatown.

> “We still hear anecdotes of people going to discos and night clubs, and gathering together in large groups – our big worry is that these can become super-spreader events, spawning new clusters and potential runaway outbreaks,” he said.

> 

> This is why authorities announced “another set of brakes” on Tuesday, with the aim of limiting gatherings outside of work and school to less than 10 people.

> 

> “These are major moves to slow the spread of the virus,” the minister said. “We recognise the inconvenience and disruption that these measures will bring to people’s lives, and to businesses, but we have no easy options.”

> 

> Mr Wong noted that this is the reality that countries around the world are facing while fighting COVID-19.

> “The more we try to stop or slow down the virus, the steeper will be the damage on our economies.

> 

> “So we have to do what is necessary from the public health point of view first – to save lives, slow down the virus – and thereafter, do our best to manage the economic consequences,” he said, noting that the new measures have been shared with the team at the Ministry of Finance which will take these into consideration for the second support package set to be announced on Thursday.

> 

> Discharged COVID-19 patient Ms Jiang (in yellow) poses for a photo with doctors and nurses at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. (Photo: Ms Jiang)

> “We are now at a critical phase in our fight against the virus,” said the minister, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak here.

> 

> Even with the latest measures, it is also possible that the number of infected cases could continue to rise. If that is the case, Singapore may need “more drastic measures”, such as suspending schools and closure of some workplaces aside from those providing essential services.

> 

> “So we will keep the measures under constant review. If the situation worsens, we will apply extra brakes.

> “If the situation improves, we may be able to ease off a little bit but not go back to baseline … because the pandemic will probably still not be over for quite some time,” he said.

> 

> Mr Wong also urged all Singaporeans to cooperate and take the latest set of measures “very seriously”.

> 

> “The fight against the virus cannot be done by frontline agencies, frontline workers or government agencies alone,” he said. “Each and every one of us has to actively do our part.”

> 

> In his speech, Mr Wong also paid tribute to the healthcare workers on the frontline, public servants and officials who have been working around the clock, as well as unsung heroes in various sectors like cleaning, security, airport management, media, hotels, F&B and transport.

They absolutely should close. People are touching betting slips, sharing pencils and hanging out in close proximity. Singapore Pools is a state owned company so the government could close it down temporarily. Plus people should stop gambling now. Use the money for more important things during these tough times. And it’s generally older people too.

Then when it finally worked I got to the video call and my audio wasn't getting through to the person on the other end and they just kept hanging up on me without saying anything. I had to call their CS who wasn't helpful at all, just kept asking me how close my mouth was to my mic (I was using my phone duh). In the end I figured out it was because I was using firefox instead of chrome. Apparently their video call doesn't work on firefox.

I signed up for an account many years back, and the process was quite easy. It's the minimum topup of $100 that put me off.

> # COVID-19 isn't going to wait for us, stay at home as much as you can: Lawrence Wong

> SINGAPORE — With the number of imported cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise, the risk of locally transmitted cases will also increase, making the threat of a widespread virus outbreak “very real”, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> Hence, practising safe distancing and minimising social activities is important in slowing down the spread of the virus, and public venues and roads are already less crowded, he noted during a press conference on Tuesday (24 March).

> However, the adjustments to Singaporeans’ daily lives are taking place too slowly, said Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

> “The virus isn’t going to wait for us. It is continuing to spread and circulate in our population, and anytime you can get an outbreak,” he said.

> “It is of great concern that you still hear stories of people gathering together. You still hear anecdotes of people gathering in clubs, in discos, where there are large social gatherings which can easily become super-spreader events, and then another cluster will break out after that.”

> On Tuesday, the taskforce announced a slew of measures to further minimise the spread of the new virus.

> Among other things, all bars and entertainment venues - including night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets - will be closed at least till end-April. All events will also be cancelled, while gatherings outside of work and school should be limited to 10 attendees or fewer.

> Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes, as well as religious services and congregations will also be suspended.

> Wong said the taskforce hopes Singaporeans will take the measures seriously as they are meant to minimise the risk of local transmission.

> “Our key message to all Singaporeans is stay at home as much as you can. Go out if you need to work, go to school, go out for essential tasks, but otherwise stay at home, reduce your social gatherings and all other activities for the next one month,” he said.

> “It is only by all of us reducing our activity level and the intensity of our contacts – that’s the only way where we can significantly reduce the chance of this virus spreading further in our community. And so this is a collective endeavour and we need Singaporeans to really take this task seriously.”

> As of Tuesday, Singapore confirmed 49 new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 558. 17 remain in the intensive care unit while two have died.

> Meanwhile, there are close to 396,000 COVID-19 cases globally as of Tuesday. More than 17,000 have died from the virus, with the death tolls in China and Italy accounting for more than half of the figure.

Stay Home? Hah people have to go to work. Most by public transport peak period rush hour. Not everyone can work from home. And if really got lockdown I don’t know how the workers will get paid. Companies here are stingy AF. They probably force workers to take their annual leaves. We don’t even have unemployment insurance here.

=== Author: marcuschookt===
Then legislate it. Every other country that has gone into lockdown has been forced to do so by their governments. Organizations aren't going to proactively do it, it just doesn't make sense.

=== Author: saisidd===
Don't understand what the taskforce is trying to accomplish here. If you want people to stay at home raise the DORSCON level.

Almost every new measure being put in place is as if we're in DORSCON red, eg. social distancing but they just don't want to say the word red. From what I can see the govt. is just afraid of raising the official level as it might lead to panic.  But the taskforce needs to understand this, people will not confine themselves because the current DORSCON level does not require people to practice social distancing.

=== Author: mortichro===
How about you delay that GST on netflix and other online streaming and gaming stuff so people will afford to stay home?

They have to ask their own staff to do it first. Not sure how can they do that with everything in their intranet.

=== Author: skaiblade===
To be fair, the situation when he said that and the situation now are vastly different. It is not surprising for the message to change. 

When he said that, most cases were linked cases and in generally small numbers. It was safe to go out as long as you take personal hygiene precautions. 

This spike in cases that we are seeing are mainly imported cases from returning citizens, except for yesterday where there was a increase to 13 unlinked cases. It is therefore now appropriate to ask people to stay home as much as possible.

=== Author: Flucker_Plucker===
If the bigger SG based companies don't even do it, I don't think SMEs will ever do it. The only people I know work from home are from the MNCs, who at least try to take the health of their workers seriously.

=== Author: dunspamme===
Agreed. Some kind of jobs are impossible to work from home. Manufacturing, F&B, retail ; jobs with heavy NDA or classified data, jobs using proprietary software or fixed hardware license, sales jobs that rely on ""entertaining"" clients etc.
  
The good thing about these jobs is that you can't bring work home, so your home time is your personal time. But the obvious downside is that the entire project will halt during a lockdown.

=== Author: evilplushie===
You left out the as much as you can part of his sentence

=== Author: Darkblade48===
My company in a nutshell. Work from home? You try that, and it's going to be deducted from your annual leave. You better show up for work.

If the government ever mandated work from home, and given the role I do (where I cannot do work at home), my company would probably make us take annual leave. No more leave? No pay leave for sure.

=== Author: Syncopat3d===
To ease the pain on businesses that let staff stay home and to make it easier for everyone to just shutdown, the government could mandate the suspension of rent & mortgage and extend land leases for participating organizations. Maybe even suspend interest accrual on loans. The most basic needs are food & shelter, so maybe free food for everyone. Basic nutritious food is very cheap to make at scale. If you want a large selection or very tasty food, that's a different story.

The current situation is different but entirely imaginable then especially given the experience in other places like Wuhan where even official (under-estimated) numbers paint a picture of a very contagious disease.

Disease spreads exponentially. Case numbers increase exponentially especially when there are cases with unknown origin (it means there is probably an exponentially growing number of cases that are undetected). Hesitate on implementing countermeasures for what may seem like a short time and then it'll be game over.

=== Author: ForgotRedditPwd===
Whatever cases pop up are infection from 1-2 weeks ago, so it is concerning that we failed to stamp out the local cases after so long since the 1st case. It feels like the tracing is always a step behind the virus spread.

Normal. The situation changes too rapidly. Just 2 weeks ago (when PM said that), US had less than 10 cases. Now its many thousands. Who could have predicted that?

=== Author: GhostBearKhan===
not every ministry has that luxury.

=== Author: skaiblade===
When it comes to the timing of implementing countermeasures, it always boils down to the same few arguments, i.e. that it's a balancing act between different priorities. 

The government have been advised by numerous professors in epidemiology and doctors and have access to a much larger picture of how the country is performing in different facets than we do. I trust in their ability to calibrate measures accordingly.

Again, a testament to the adequacy of their decisions is that before Singaporeans started returning home, the situation was very much controlled. We have only started to see exponential growth and strain on our healthcare following the massive influx of returning Singaporeans and they are pushing out measures to attempt to keep ahead of the curve, e.g. those announced yesterday.

We can argue about the efficacy of their measures but it will always be post-factum and cannot compare to them making decision in the moment.

=== Author: blizstorm===
the harvard report, that praised singapore as gold standard for border detection back in early feb indirectly predicted this actually

=== Author: zed_j===
Everyone could have predicted that because it’s  already widely published there is exponential spread. Anyone with a bit of foresight could have seen it coming.

=== Author: WittyKap0===
Well I could have predicted that for sure. 

If you understand how contagious the disease is and how poorly controlled it is outside sg (look at our neighbours) and given the myriad anecdotal reports on US attitudes prior to the Washington outbreak then you could predict it too.

There was a thread on a Goldman investor call a month ago. You should always trust big money to know what's up

They shouldn't have downplayed it as a mild flu in the first place, if they didn't have sufficient information. 

First impressions count. The first message stays longer and subsequent messages might not be as effectively understood. Especially when there's different speakers (first pm, then this minister, that minister) coming out to say something different.

""oh PM said it's mild, don't worry. His rank is higher than Lawrence. Listen to PM.""

It should be whoever said the message first, should come out to correct himself.

Wah serious ah? Wat an arsehole Boss....

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
No I not referring to action, I'm referring to the significance of the code.

Eg. If Singapore goes into lockdown without raising the dorson level does it make any difference?

We can go into a lockdown without going to levels of Italy, does it mean we should be in orange or red

And where does it state that social distancing and closing of events means its red.

Imo they don't want to raise the code because people overreact based on it and don't unds the meaning.

They also don't want to restrict movement yet when the situation is not too bad allowing people and businesses to prepare.

=== Author: GalerionTheAnnoyed===

Ok. You can be the PM then. I am really caught off guard by the developments. I knew the situation will worsen; but not this badly. New York City situation is wholly out of control. 15k cases in less than a week. Wow. 

I was just betting with my friends last week that a lockdown is unlikely in the US. I thought that the situation though bad will be under control soon. Not explode so exponentially. So wellz, I lost my bet. And I learnt my lesson - that these kind of situations are really really volatile

=== Author: redwithin===
No one in the Singapore government has downplayed it as a mild flu.

And PM Lee's second announcement was pretty much him saying things have changed and expect tighter measures soon. The only thing is he didn't mention (or know yet) how much tighter they would get and how quickly.

=== Author: chaujie328===
Yes. While first impression counts, you need to see in context. In a normal circumstance, these kind of messaging will not happen. But this is not normal times. Situation is very volatile. Can you predict how many local transmission there will be today? Can you predict how many imported cases there will be today? 

In this case, all the Ministers work as a team. If you actually follow the reports, you will see that they are all part of the same task force. So all the Ministers are equal and they have already discussed everything beforehand. 

My point of this is - simply - please be fair to them. No one knows what will happen. Therefore instructions will change. The situation is in control today; but overnight, it can worsen. In that 2hours, policy must change.

=== Author: tubbycat1===
I suspect it because the boss don't know how to use Excel.

=== Author: saisidd===
The code is just tells us how serious the situation is. 
People don't want to stay at home because in their mind the code is still orange.
Raise it to red and you people will start appreciating the seriousness of the situation. 
So far all these advisories and yet people travel and congregate in malls. Do you see any other way to get people to stay at home?

It really depends on what lockdown means but with the right definition I would have bet my life savings on it. After living in the US for many years, I know the healthcare system is fucked and people are not going to get the care they need, go to work sick, not see a doctor etc unless it's a government decree (and do they even have the resources to enforce a real lockdown, idk) 

Tbh PM and cabinet likely knew all along it was going to be a shit storm they just want to let the economy run for as long as reasonably possible to minimize the pain

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
It's not the code that will stop the outliers from going out.

You are stating that raising it to red will cause those defiant people to stay home? Without enforcement nothing will change. Are you saying that once you change the code people will not violate SHN? 

Its the action that matters, not the code. The code is just a reference for the action.

People need to stop obsessing with the code and stop asking the gov to change the code. Let them do their job.

=== Author: GalerionTheAnnoyed===
Haha well to be fair it depends on how much they do it on a regular basis. If the work comes in chunks and there are periods where they have to do work at home on weekends or etc then it'll be less weird for them.

Singaporean student studying in Japan. 

Was supposed to fly back on the 29th but jetstar canceled my flight. Can’t find alternative flights out of here anymore. 

Wasn’t able to take an earlier flight out because of graduation ceremony and school wants me to leave the dormitory by the 31st. Country law doesn’t allow me to work here (part-time) anymore after graduation so I am currently jobless and soon to be homeless. Was supposed to apply for a working visa but company documents haven’t arrived yet so I can’t apply for it either. 

Not very sure what to do from here onwards... If i should come back to Singapore for good and seek work or hope that the documents come down during the next few days so i can stay and work here. Anyone, any advice ?

I didn’t migrate, I’m just studying and working in Australia. 

But I’ll tell you that I’ve learnt to appreciate our government in times of crisis. Whenever they come out to address new measures, they are straight to the point with infographics available immediately all over social media so it’s easy. The benefits of what the world calls an authoritarian government is that things get done fast. 

Last night I watched Scott Morrison (Australian PM) address the nation about further restriction on businesses and activies. It was hard to watch because everyone kept getting lost with what he was saying. Even the news reported it wrongly because everyone thought he said shopping centres will be closed but apparently it was suppose to be food courts in supermarkets.

(Also, he keeps bringing up Singapore when questioned why Australia aren’t closing schools. Australians are like “because Singapore’s doing much better than you are”. Everytime I hear that I touch some wood and hope no one jinx it.)

Every time when the news informa that the PM is addressing, people will freak out a little and panic over what’s to come because of a government that doesn’t inspire confidence.

Although I have to add, the lack of trust in the government meant that most Australians are being responsible in their own means. Most people here are on casual pay and businesses closing means the end of their income. It is in everybody’s self-interest to end this. While in Singapore, we live such a nice comfy life that even while studying, most of us don’t have to worry about a job or about rent.

Permanent resident of Canada here. 

Where I am right now, the city changed during this period. It's a lot quieter than it used to be, people are generally adhering to social distancing rules, staying at home as much as possible. Work life balance has always been the norm here, so converting to telecommuting for most occupations seem to be relatively painless. The rapidity in response to the crisis wasn't top notch, but the subsequent measures to 'flatten the curve' more than compensated for it. Provincially we're the richest in the nation, tested most in the nation, so even though we acknowledge that there's a pandemic out and about, for the most part people aren't losing their marbles or confidence in the government yet (either provincial or federal).  

Personally, the decision to migrate wasn't made in a vacuum, and there's a myriad of factors pushing and pulling our move away from Singapore to Canada. The response to COVID-19 likewise only affects a small part of how we perceive where we are now and where we came from. We always knew that there would be discrepancies between the level of efficiency in governance when comparing to a country like Singapore, which sets the bar really high for the most part, so we acknowledge that in this respect, the speed, impact and foresight the Singapore government has dealt with this crisis has been truly commendable. 

However, if you're asking if it wavered our belief that migration was the best choice for us, then unfortunately no. Nothing changed for the most part, culturally, socially, or even economically. Singapore is still crowded, Singaporeans are still... for want of a neutral term, Singaporeans. The economic fallout from the impact of COVID-19 will be global, so everybody will be negatively impacted, with the severity determined more by your occupation itself rather than the country you are at. Where I'm at, it's so sparsely populated to begin with, and now it's even quieter, which for me is a huge plus, not to mention with a smaller population there's really only so much hoarding that can be done to impact our stock levels in the grocery stores. Ahead in the distance there's the mountains to run to even while social distancing, filled with isolated hiking trails and quiet parks nestled in off-beaten reserves. I don't have to jostle amidst the crowds, I don't have to crawl behind the traffic. If I lose my job because of COVID-19, the government gives me 55% of my regular income for 42 weeks to tide me over the period, at the same time I get to utilise the myriad programs available to go for sponsored courses that are fully paid for. 

I have my own place with my own backyard to get busy with. Spring just arrived and it's time to start watering the perennials sprouting from my little garden, and arranging the trellises so the pea vines can creep up my fence once more. As the weather gets warmer, we'll start moving things outdoors in the comfort of our home, barbecue for our small little family when it's nice and comfy out, sitting underneath our gazebo looking at the sunset with a glass of red. We bought the place at $202 per square foot freehold, a decent living space at a price cheaper than what HDB is able to provide in any conceivable measure, and we're 10 minutes away from downtown. What's the price at Toa Payoh now? $600 per square foot for a 99 year lease? Food prices are about the same if you cook instead of eat out, and you can actually afford the time to enjoy the process of making dinner and having it with your family. 

All that time chasing for something to end up in a small box without the time to enjoy it. 

Do I miss the food in Singapore? Yes. It's surprisingly hard to make oyster omelette taste the way it does in Singapore. Do I miss the quick travel destinations nearby? Yes. It's been so long since we've been to a beach and listened to the waves. Do I miss my family and friends? Definitely, but with two spare guest bedrooms and a spare car in the garage they're always welcomed to visit. I miss the little things, but I am grateful I have in spades, what really matters to me most now. 

Hope everybody stay safe and healthy during this COVID-19 phase. Cheers.

I was living in the UK but came back to singapore to seek solace from the outbreak.

On a day to day basis, both countries have their pros and cons. But in a crisis such as a pandemic, hands-down singapore is the place to be. 

A lot has already been said about how well the singapore government has handled this, but the most interesting thing  I've noticed is the certainty, trust and confidence that the government inspires. In singapore, you can trust that the government is taking the best measures, prioritising correctly between public health and the economy and you know that singaporeans will more or less comply with the quarantine and SHN.

This is not the case in UK where I am not sure whether i can trust that the UK government is making the best decisions or that UK residents would comply.

Another noticeable difference is that, while in singapore, the numbers are not optimistic, the situation feels so much more high-stakes in UK. The numbers and deaths in UK are much higher, the panic buying seems uncontrollable and their health system does not seem to be able to cope. On the other hand in sg, our death rate is minimal and the health system seems to be more than capable of dealing with it. the measures imposed by the sg government also are decisive and likely to be complied with...

Not really changed, per se. Before this, living in trump country has already convinced to move home after my career stabilises and my CV is long enough. This just affirmed my decision.

It's just sad that it took almost half a decade of living overseas before I truly realised how privileged I was to be in Singapore. Cynicism about Singapore is a powerful drug, and it took me quite a while to stop making up excuses for my reduced quality of life and the shitty people around me.

Here, I can

1. Work from home without my employer complaining

2. Drive to and from work and not take crowded public transport

3. Go hiking in nature despite the virus

4. Have a large enough house to own a dog and feel less lonely while stuck at home

So yes, I would choose to stay.

Singaporean here. Been studying in the UK for the past 4 years and planning to work here for another few. Always told myself id go back to sg sooner or later but with every passing day, i feel it's gonna be sooner. Still planning on working here for a few years at least but no way in hell am I retiring here. Unless maybe i become a billionaire, cause life is pretty much the same anywhere you go if you're a billionaire.

Currently into second week of sheltering in place in the US and it feels surreal to see friends in SG posting about eating out and clubbing. I don't think there's any place like what is going on in SG... BUT it's going to be much worse spending lockdown in SG. I can't imagine staying shut in a tiny, hot HDB flat.

I've been watching the latest series of WestWorld and yes, the scenes shot in SG are amazing, with all the futuristic buildings. I was never a fan of such structures. I hate the sameness of the HDB towns, and the fact that you can't look out of the window without looking into someone else's window. I'm living in a 150 year old, 2-storey apartment which costs less than the rent of a 3-room HDB flat (not taking into account the exchange rate). 

I work in tech and am getting paid much more than I would be in SG. The work culture is different - the tech team is protected and there's no pressure to compete with cheap labor from neighboring countries.

SG is in a really vulnerable position, it's too scary to think about it when one is living in SG. It's a small city with no hinterland, and located in region of, frankly, banana republics. Yes, Trump is a terrible president, but during the China tradewars, I was happy to be a place that China can't bully. 

It's frustrating to be in a small city-state that can't afford to tell it's neighbors to ""f-off"" when they let toxic chemical fumes and smoke blow into your face, and just have to put up with their bs. It does suck to be small.

Australian resident here. Suffice it to say that the quality of life here during the last decade, has been amazing. Certainly a move in the right direction.

Unfortunately I won't be returning to live in a country that is overpopulated, rife with dengue fever and now the novel virus. The annual smoke haze just makes it worse.

Singapore has undeniably become a soulless, materialistic society. Poor work-life balance coupled with an average work culture. It gets more and more evident each passing year when I return for a holiday and hear what friends have to say.

This novel virus has done nothing to change my perception of the country. No nation is spared from this contagion. As far as dealing with situation goes,  most governments are generally moving in the same direction with economic stimuli; albeit at different speeds. Will we see QE and eventually the elusive UBI that a minority is clamouring for? It's anyone's guess. 

I still think the Singapore is prioritising the GDP over lives, but it probably can't be helped for several reasons which should be pretty obvious to everyone by now.

I am living and working in Australia too, and I'm not Singaporean but I spent a huge chunk of my childhood there.

I have said consistently that the Australian government just doesn't inspire the same confidence in the people as the Singaporean government, which is so important in a time like this. The messages we get from the government here are mixed, confusing and often just... yelling? Like the one conference Morrison had where he just scolded at people for hoarding. His messages are unclear and his speeches are uninspiring and cause more panic and confusion, whereas the address from LHL calmed people down, made them feel united, and reassured them that the government was doing all they could, and were transparent in the measures they were taking. Here, the state and federal governments just point fingers at each other and put out conflicting rules and always seem to be doing too little, too late. 

The biggest thing is though, that because the government doesn't seem to be taking it seriously, the people here don't either. The Australian mentality of ""she'll be right, mate"" really does prevail, and I don't blame the general population for still thinking that when it's leaders also seem to think that way. 

I personally have been staying home as much as possible (with an infant, I'm quite worried about this whole situation) but every time I do have to go out to buy supplies I get very anxious because I'm just not confident that the right people (whether in govt or in the general population) are taking the right measures, whereas my relatives in Singapore are not as worried because they are confident that they are being looked out for.

In saying that though, the fact that my family has access to Medicare, the flexibility to work from home or take leave with minimal questions asked (and generally a great work-life balance) and the support net of Centrelink should we need it (we are very fortunate that we don't) is quite nice. Plus, the 1 year paid maternity leave that I am still on is awesome. 

tl;dr Singaporean government taking charge the way they are now is nice but I don't think that in general I would move back to Singapore.

=== Author: Satireisus===
Thanks for your honest opinion. I always felt that authoritarianism was underrated. See how China brought its country under control in this crisis. Australia and other first World countries in Europe and North America allow their citizens to think for themselves and protect their individual rights with a passion. We however have toed the line religiously and we can clearly see the results. It's not a surprise that thousand of Australians migrate to Singapore but only a few Singaporeans migrate to Australia and numbers don't lie.

I have lived in Australia for the last decade too and don't think I would return for the same reasons, but I do miss a lot of things about Singapore, such as the availability of cheap and varied food/groceries/international brands, the ease of travel overseas, and the quality of the public transport etc. However, the non-existent work-life balance and attitude to work really turns me off and probably outweighs a lot of the things I miss about Singapore if I'm honest. For example, here in Australia I get one year paid maternity leave, and I was expected to take it. My cousin in Singapore in comparison only had 3 months off and her boss gave her a lot of shit for taking the full entitlement. 

Plus, I will miss Medicare, lol.

Nah we would never know how much better the virus might have been handled in the beginning if China didn't try to suppress news of it in the first place. The shining example in this whole mess should go to South Korea. They managed to keep their cool and do massive contact tracing, testing, all without resorting to severe authoritarian measures.

=== Author: New-Function===
I brought up the app that Singapore has developed for contact tracing and the disgust was immediate.

I agree with you that authoritarian is great but I guess it’s been great in Singapore since our politicians are in general inherently good. But a rogue government would be able to wreck havoc without checks and balances. But hey, I doubt there’s a perfect political system.

I actually tried tapioca flour too, but it's still missing that je ne sais quoi. I honestly think it's because the quality of oysters (I'm in a land-locked province, so practically all seafood is frozen delivered), and also the fact that my range is heating element instead of gas. Can't get that heat high enough to achieve that chao tar taste that I so sorely miss.

The oysters used in SG aren't great. Have you tried using a non-stick wok? Woks conduct heat differently so even with a heating element (same here setup here) you can get the crispy char. Adding corn flour helps too.

> The task force said that the duration of the stricter measures may be extended if the situation does not improve here.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Events which were limited to 250 participants previously, like festivals and concerts, will also have to adhere to the new measures.

> The task force said in a statement that it will also close all entertainment values such as night clubs, discos, karaoke outlets, cinemas and theatres where it said there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time.

> All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended.

> “This is to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students,” according to the statement.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> All religious services and congregations will also be suspended, although places of worship may remain open for private worship and essential rites, subject to a group size of up to 10.

> Shows within attractions, whether indoor or outdoor, group tours at museums and open atrium sales events will also be suspended. Supermarkets can go ahead with such atrium sales events as they may be used to disperse crowds from their stores, the task force said.

> Organised tours within public venues such as sightseeing and guided walking tours will also be suspended.

> “Activities like live music or karaoke that are likely to cause patrons to congregate will have to cease,” the task force said.

> Suspension of activities for seniors will also be extended till Apr 30.

> “During this time, we advise seniors and individuals with underlying chronic medical conditions to avoid social gatherings as far as possible,” the task force said.

> RETAIL MALLS, ATTRACTIONS MAY OPEN, BUT HAVE TO ADHERE TO REQUIREMENTS

> While venues such as retail malls, attractions and museums may remain open, as contact is more transient in these places, operators are expected to adhere to strict requirements.

> These include reducing operating capacity so that the venue does not have more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space, in order to prevent crowding, ensuring groups do not exceed 10 people, and allowing at least one metre of physical spacing between patrons.

> “Retail malls and attractions that are unable to adhere to these requirements must be closed,” the task force said.

> The task force cautioned that retail malls and attractions may face additional penalties if they are found to have been a place of transmission of COVID-19 and found not to have adhered to the requirements.

> Dining venues will also have to ensure they take safe distancing precautions. Those with fixed seating will have to use alternate seating. While related diners may sit together at one table, tables must be “spaced out”, according to the statement.

> The task force advised Singaporeans to avoid holding and participating in social events and gatherings involving more than 10 people, including weddings and birthdays.

> “For funerals and wakes, attendance should be limited as far as possible to family members only, and gatherings of 10 or fewer people at any one time,” it said.

> “Much as we understand the need for friends and acquaintances to pay their last respects, and give comfort to families in their grief, we urge the public to do their part in minimising social interactions so that we can slow down the spread of the virus together.”

It’s such a gray area for some companies. What do you think about Center based therapy places? Where kids come from different schools for a few hours of therapy each. Some don’t attend schools but most attend some form of school or attend other therapies such as speech or physio. Some of these companies also conduct home sessions with kids who attend different schools. The Teachers teach both in the Centers and home. They might be going from home to home in a day where kids are from different schools.

Curious about this too. Climbing gyms for me. Though with all the shared hand contact on climbing holds I think they will be closed. Tomorrow call and ask.

=== Author: awesomepabo===
From what i know as i gym quite often, the activesg gym near me actually has a rule where only a certain number of people are allowed to ENTER the gym. It was initially 40 people allowed but because of social distancing, they have decreased the number to around 25. Others will have to wait outside with queue numbers and wait to be called in. One out one in. So no, gyms wont be closed but there's strict regulations now.

It’s not that weak tbh. If you think about it, mobility between tuition center is extremely high and non-controllable. Students can change center within a day, with no way for govt to track/control. 
Meanwhile you cannot change school Willy nilly. So this makes sure students always mingle within same group, and limit the clusters. 

The same argument can be made for cancelling either work or school, but the economic impacts from doing either one of these is too big to be worth the trade-off at the moment.

=== Author: Gneissguys===
Simple, you don't want it to pass from school to school. Because in one center, you get multiple students from different schools. Now most schools all implement measures where you pretty much hang around your class only.

=== Author: samglit===
Can’t close schools without childcare or crippling the economy.  If one school is infected, you can close that school. If a tuition center with kids from 20 schools is infected, closing 20 schools becomes a problem.

=== Author: BunnanasS===
Damn sian, I’m doing private candidate and getting classes in tuition centres. If the classes all kena cancelled then studying damn hard sia how to score well for o levels? :(

=== Author: redwithin===
The control that Government has over schools vis-a-vis that over centres is vastly different. You can be sure that there will be some centres that won't even be doing the minimum to ensure the students are safe, as it will be a threat to profits.

On a big picture level though, I haven't been able to find any cases worldwide of mass spreading in schools (but lots in nursing homes). A positive view on this is that the virus simply isn't infecting and spreading amongst children (which is also true based on infection rate and death rate). A negative view might be that kids might end up being silent spreaders - no symptoms, but able to pass it on to their grandparents unknowingly (Note that even in places with extensive testing like South Korea, however, there is no evidence of this happening).

=== Author: xdKme===
Exactly my sentiments. I'm a student living in the east going all the way to bukit timah everyday to and Fro. that's +-2 hours on public transport for me and the amount of people on the train is no joke with let's say 20+ people per compartment at a peak hour around 7.30.

Events
12.          All events and mass gatherings (e.g. conferences, exhibitions, festivals, concerts, sporting events, trade fairs) must be deferred or cancelled, regardless of size. This is a tightening of the previous requirement where all events and gatherings were to be limited to fewer than 250 participants.
13.          Singaporeans are advised to avoid holding and participating in social events and gatherings involving more than 10 persons at any one time. These include private celebrations like birthdays and weddings. For funerals and wakes, attendance should be limited as far as possible to family members only, and gatherings of 10 or fewer people at any one point. Much as we understand the need for friends and acquaintances to pay their last respects and give comfort to families in their grief, we urge the public to do their part in minimising social interactions so that we can slow down the spread of the virus together. 

Only advised

A lot of short sighted people think that any lockdown measures can only be detrimental.

If this situation goes out of hand, we will be forced into full lockdown mode like some countries. When we get to that stage, you want to work also cannot!

Now, we make some sacrifice, cause some small disruption to work, so that we don’t have to close this country down. Right now, some might have to contend with reduced income and being forced on no pay leave due to cost cutting measures, but companies can still struggle on. 

If we are forced to go on prolonged full lockdown (due to widespread outbreak), the impact will be very detrimental (everyone on no pay leave, self-employed totally get no income at all). The damage to the economy of a forced full lockdown will be worse! The lesser we do anything now, the faster we bring forward the worse case scenario.

Do you want the shortsighted benefit now but lose everything later?

This is a balance. Don’t look at the short term benefit and forget the bigger picture and issue.

=== Author: tallbean_===
Yeah you're right, those who rely on bars and nightlife for income will also be facing a huge problem alongside many others. Hope everyone remains positive + the govt considers measures to help those who are going to be very affected by the shutdown.

If community spread continues to worsen over time, it's likely that we do a full lockdown and/or curfew like in Europe and the impact is going to be even worse. I hope with this measure, we can control community spread and regain normality soon.

Or maybe spooked by Italy.

No ~~lock down~~ dispersing crowd=cfm spread like siao eventually. No 2 way around it. And if the spread happen in a large crowd, which so far sg is lucky with only 2 cluster being the safra dinner and church, too late to control by then.

=== Author: retaki===
There’s 17 new cases from local transmission today (so far 13 of them are unlinked). 

Contrasts it with 6 new cases each from local transmission on last 2 days.

This is a huge increase and suggests that they might be new clusters or highly contagious means of transmission that has been overlooked. Thus resulting in stepping up of the measure.

Also, until all local cases are linked and followed by a few days of low number/zero cases, it is possible to continue to have spikes in cases due to new clusters.

closing businesses for x days will reduce their income for x days.

closing school for x days will 1) result in parents unable to take care of children, if one parent take leave will reduce income, 2) more importantly, it stagnates the learning of these kids, will have future implication if the school year is delayed, especially for the kids in transition year, PSLE, O level, A level, trickling forward into our future economy.

nobody said the purpose was to have a pretend sense of normalcy. life must go on because these are essential activity for SG to recover after the virus is gone

govt can use quantitative easing to save businesses later on, but money cant buy back lost education time for a generation

From a purely financial standpoint :

*Disclaimer - All costs are out of my ass

Deposit for nice hotel wedding =5k

+Cost if wedding held for 12 tables =25k

Misc cost for add ons/changes on day =1k (could include dress/photography/dj/etc. +alot more of course, 1k is major lowball)

You get a pretty awesome and traditional wedding. You lose Total approx 30k.

Deposit for nice hotel wedding = 5k

Coronastyle Restaurant wedding for 10 pax or less =15k likely lower*, tung lok seafood is like 600 ish.

You get a smaller wedding. You lose approx 20k.

Sunk cost fallacy is essentially sticking to a bad choice just because you already committed early. In both cases the 5k deposit has already been burnt, but you save 10k in the coronastyle case, admittedly with numbers pulled out of nowhere just to illustrate the point.

Edit: for it not to be a sunk cost, the deposit must be higher than the cost of holding the cheaper wedding, but I don't think any place will ask for more than 50% deposit, which is already insane.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Given that in a time of no crisis and no imminent danger, constitutional amendments were made in 2016 to allow the presidency to be reserved, why should we not move to similarly amend the constitution to add a clause that permits the mandate of the government to be extended until the conclusion of the crisis, and to be immediately dissolved once the crisis has abated?

This would be something I think no one would disagree with, especially since the elections called at this juncture would compel many who are serving quarantines, the sick who are invalid to forego their right to vote, in addition to inducing a mass movement which will raise the risk of infection. It seems very short sighted to call the election amidst the crisis.

> # Early General Election will provide new govt with fresh mandate to lead the country through Covid-19 crisis: Teo Chee Hean

> While the current Covid-19 situation is not ideal for holding an election, that does not mean an election is impossible, according to Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean.

> According to Teo, now more than ever, Singaporeans need a government that the people has expressed confidence in, in order to take Singaporeans through the Covid-19 crisis.

> This was Teo’s response in Parliament to a question posed by Member of Parliament (MP) Christopher de Souza, who asked for the government’s stance on a possible caretaker government, formed using the President’s soft power, in order to allow a fresh election to only be conducted after the Covid-19 situation stabilises.

> This idea was originally suggested by Tan Cheng Bock, secretary-general of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP).

> Important for government to have a clear mandate to lead Singapore through the crisis

> In response to this suggestion, Teo said that the Covid-19 crisis may get worse, before getting better eventually.

> He said that although we can hope and pray that things will stabilise, it is unclear when the Covid-19 situation will stabilise, and whether it will do so within the next year.

> He stated that the term of Singapore’s 13th parliament will end on Jan. 14, 2021, and the election must be held within three months of that, which means on or before April 14, 2021.

> Although Teo emphasised that a decision on the timing of the General Election (GE) has yet to be taken, he said that an election must take place by April 14, 2021.

> “The longer we wait, the more unpredictable, difficult and dangerous it could be,” he said.

> Teo said that by going for an early election, the new government will be given a clear and fresh mandate to lead the country through this major crisis.

> “When you are sailing into a storm, you want to be certain who your captain is, and that he will not be changed halfway. You want to make sure that he’s there, together with you, working with you, guiding you through the storm,” said Teo.

> Teo: Suggestion to delay election lack understanding of the Constitution

> Teo also said that some suggestions about the election issue have been “misleading and unhelpful”.

> Regarding the suggestion to delay the General Election beyond the required timeframe of April 2021, Teo said that based on the advice he received from the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC), such an action is unconstitutional.

> “The only circumstances when the election can be put off beyond the required date is when a state of emergency is declared,” he said.

> Teo pointed out that Singapore has weathered many crises since its independence, but it has never once declared a state of emergency, so the decision to do so must not be taken lightly.

> He also said that the President’s power to declare an emergency can only be exercised on the advice of the Cabinet, and given that the incumbent Cabinet remains in office during an emergency, there is no legal basis or practical need for the President to form a new government.

> Teo said that it is “not helpful” to mislead people into thinking such an option to put off an election indefinitely exists, given how it goes against the Constitution.

> Teo also said that the suggestion to form a caretaker government would be hindered by the lack of “explicit mandate voters”, hence lacking the position to make major decisions on behalf of Singaporeans.

> He said that the fundamental problem with a caretaker government is that constitutional convention requires that a caretaker government not make any far-reaching or long term measures.

> Such a government would lack a clear mandate to implement strong measures to mobilise Singapore’s resources and reserves to implement strong economic stabilisation measures to steer the country through the Covid-19 crisis, which is not in the best interest of Singapore and its people.

> Teo said that such suggestions show a “disregard for, or lack of understanding of the Constitution,” and that putting forward constitutionally unworkable proposals at a time of serious national crisis can only confuse and mislead Singaporeans.

> Current Covid-19 measures will be maintained during General Election

> In response to a second question posed by de Souza, regarding the measures to ensure the safety of Singaporeans during the election, Teo said that comprehensive measures have already been implemented over the past few weeks at every level.

> He said that if an election takes place during the Covid-19 crisis, none of the necessary measures will be disrupted, but admitted that the next election will necessarily be different from past elections, due to Covid-19.

> Teo said that at every step of the way, throughout nominations, campaigning and voting, the government will make the necessary arrangements to ensure that parties can campaign effectively and people can vote safely.

> “For example, for campaigning, we can have live streaming or speeches on the internet, adequate TV time for candidates. For voting, we already have special express lanes for seniors, and those who need them. We can also have social distancing while queuing, proper hand hygiene for voting paraphernalia, hand sanitisers for voters,” he said.

> Teo said that Singapore will learn from the experiences of other countries that are holding elections during the Covid-19 outbreak, and that whatever measures taken will affect all political parties equally.

> He said that although no decision has been taken yet on the timing of the GE, such additional measures and precautions will be needed, whether the election is held early or later.

Im not religious or anything, but this is basically them saying politics is more important than religion, that too with such a flimsy reason. It is highly irresponsible to host this election - voter turnout will be low ( ur forcing us to endanger ourselves- and what about those in shn health care workers etc, ) and it will definitely be a platform for further spread. It also disadvantages opposition ( i have no political affiliation or anything but this seems completely unfair - which is why they are doing it, i suppose)

If they are thinking of capitalising on this crisis to try and secure their seats for another 4-5 years, I just might be irritated enough to vote for the opposition. Just because.

=== Author: Skythewood===
They can't because it's unconstitutional. What they can do is declare a state of emergency and hold on to power until crisis is over. Tan Cheng Bock's idea of dissolve government and appointing caretaker government is just very weird for a veteran politician.

=== Author: 123dream321===
Don't agree with them to hold elections now but I do think what he had said makes some sense.

 Let's say the solutions/measurements they have for covid and incoming economy recession is highly unpopular with the people but considered necessary by them. Baring in mind that PAP did create policies that are unpopular with the people. Without mandate from the people, 4g ministers will be much more reserved in going ahead with such decisions, scared that the people give them the boot. Which will directly limit their choice of actions. 

What he say just further convinced me that we are going to have some drastic measurements / policy coming our way that are going to be very unpopular. Such as prioritizing economy over life.

 Not that I agree with trump but he said it ""we cannot let the cure be worst than the problem"" 
I'm sure he isn't the only one with this opinion

Edit: For them to make this move, this is the only reason I can think of.

Yes, very astute of you to realize that the reason why a nation can't hold an election in a timely fashion is because of a lockdown. If there is no lockdown, they will just hold an election. Depends on how optimistic you are about the pandemic situation in the coming year.             
  
And it's weird not because PAP will definitely hold the majority in the coming election, but because we *don't know* if they will hold the majority. Dissolve the government and choose who as caretaker government? Tan Cheng Bock? Based on what? If the standing government decides they can't rule and gives up, then the opposition will take over, but this isn't the case here. The time limit has simply been reached.

=== Author: Skythewood===
Why change the constitution when there is already a measure for them to delay the election? Just declare state of emergency and they can hold on to power until emergency over.          
                
And a party in power changing constitution to extend their stay in power? Pretty sure that's not democratic at all. It's also a really strange solution given that there is already a way forward.

They obviously can but why would they ? It is easier to declare state of emergency and hold absolute power without any contest.

=== Author: ksumnole69===
The PAP certainly has a vested interest in holding early elections, so that they can avert a fall in votes won should they choose to implement unpopular policies that only bear fruit in the Long run, well beyond the next election. It’s not about us worrying the PAP will be voted out, but that they will enact parochial policies now that they are actually in power, just to secure the votes during the next GE.

[Why Electronic Voting is a BAD Idea](https://youtu.be/w3_0x6oaDmI)

[Why Electronic Voting Is Still A Bad Idea](https://youtu.be/LkH2r-sNjQs)

---

Nobody is debating on the usefulness of electronic voting, but the main gripe with it is its suitability. If you have watched the video that I've posted in my comment, you would have already understood what I'm about to say.

First things first, electronic voting, especially using SingPass, breaks the most important requirement of every election: Anonymity.

No doubt SingPass is a convenient platform for all transactions with the government, but accountability is built into every nook and cranny of that system. That means your hardware identifier (serial numbers, MAC addresses of PCs/phones/routers), IP addresses or SingPass ID (NRICs, mobile numbers?, email addresses?) will be recorded by the system. These are needed for logging, security and recovery purposes.

Next, another crucial requirement: Trust. Can the electronic voting system trust that Tan Ah Gow is not using Lee Ah Mao's credentials to vote? Can the system trust that Lee Ah Mao's voting device is not maliciously compromised? Can the system trust Lee Ah Mao's vote is not altered or leaked along its route from voter to counter?

Can people without the technical know-how and details confidently trust the voting system's

* Confidentiality - votes are accessible only by the voting system and not kept or accessed by any intermediaries (e.g. Telcos, GovTech, IMDA) in its route
* Integrity - tick for Party A remains a tick, at least until the vote is counted  
* Availability - system will not be down, either by issues of its own or by hackers. And in the event of any outages, Confidentiality and Integrity remains.

Can campaigners from Political Party White and Political Party Blue trust that the electronic voting system does what it says it does and they can clearly witness its actions? Just like how they can witness the sealing and unsealing of ballot boxes?

Most importantly, can technology-illiterate Ah Gong  independently cast an e-vote without guidance, or access to an Internet-connected device?

Even if you may fully trust the electronic voting system, [human](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-than-1500-singpass-accounts-could-have-been-accessed-illegitimately-ida) is [always](https://www.asiaone.com/digital/man-hacked-and-sold-singpass-data-china-gang) the [weakest link](https://www.businessinsider.sg/a-former-presidential-candidate-was-locked-out-of-his-singpass-account-after-he-posted-personal-details-online-and-now-wants-better-security-measures-implemented) in computer security.

Fundamentally, the aspects of an election are simply a mismatch with that of electronic security.

Edit: please do not downvote the comment above mine. Heavily downvoted comments are hidden from other users, so please do not downvote it to keep this electronic voting discussion visible to more users.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Online voting is notoriously prone to hacking , much more so than a certain phone app we’ve been talking about so much. In addition, not everyone has a smartphone or should be compelled to get/use one. A paper ballot removes any ambiguity, doubt or security risk. If we’ve been afraid of our phone numbers being leaked and mass surveillance because of a Bluetooth phone app, online elections are a sure way to be the subject of a cyber security incident and put into question the sanctity, privacy and security of voting.

You are under arrest supreme chancellor

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
Read properly before replying ? You are totally missing the point here. The point is, how could the government declare a state of emergency without a curfew or lockdown of the nation ?

* And it's weird not because PAP will definitely hold the majority in the coming election, but because we don't know if they will hold the majority.*

Sorry I don’t quite get what you are trying to bring across here. So are you saying PAP will definitely hold the majority or we don’t know if they will hold the majority ?

* Dissolve the government and choose who as caretaker government? Tan Cheng Bock? Based on what? If the standing government decides they can't rule and gives up, then the opposition will take over, but this isn't the case here. The time limit has simply been reached.*

That’s TCB idea, I’m not putting my hands up for it. I’m just commenting because your thinking is bias and flawed. I’m not too sure how constitutional it will be and how it will work out should they choose to dissolve parliament and appointing a caretaker government for the time being.

=== Author: wave_327===
>	party in power changing constitution to extend their stay in power

=== Author: ngrenjie===
And incidentally, the people most disadvantaged by online voting form the bulk of PAP’s voter base. 😉

=== Author: Darkblade48===
Are you threatening me, master Jedi?

=== Author: Skythewood===
Read properly before replying? My whole post is about TCB idea. A govt can declare lockdown and then emergency at the same time, why you think that is so hard to do?

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
You are talking to a PAP member there btw.

=== Author: youcanraedtihs===
That doesn't matter because you're missing the point.

I'm assuming what you've highlighted is about the tech-illiterate crowd who votes for PAP. But the missing PAPs voters doesn't really matter when there are a whole lot of other security attack vectors in electronic voting for someone determined enough to manipulate votes.

I'm not touching that can of worms even with a ten-foot pole. And seriously, you ought to watch the videos posted in my previous comment if you haven't.

> # COVID-19: Singapore expands contact tracing teams to prepare for surge in cases

> SINGAPORE: To prepare for an ""expected surge"" in COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks, Singapore has increased the number of teams for contact tracing from three to 20, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 25).

> ""We can trace up to 4,000 contacts each day, and will continue to scale up our contact tracing capacity as needed,"" he said in a ministerial statement addressing the outbreak in Singapore.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This comes after the number of cases in Singapore doubled from 266 to 558 in the past week, with 80 per cent of new cases imported. The top three sources of importation are the UK, US and Indonesia.

> ""Over the coming weeks, the number of cases will continue to rise, as some of our around 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home from all over the world,"" Mr Gan said.

> Still, the minister said Singapore's strategy is to slow down the infection rate and maintain it at as low a level for as long as possible.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""A lower infection rate will help us to better conduct epidemiological investigations, contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, so as to prevent further spread of COVID-19 in the community,"" he said.

> 

> ""It also preserves healthcare capacity to care for the more severe cases.""

> 

> FLATTENING THE CURVE

> To achieve this, Mr Gan said Singapore has introduced stringent safe distancing and other measures, adding that while the number of cases will still grow if the measures are done right, it will end up with a ""lower peak"".

> ""This is commonly known as flattening the curve,"" he added.

> ""But by flattening the curve, we may actually stretch out the pandemic, meaning it will take longer for the pandemic to be over.""

> 

> But if Singapore does nothing, Mr Gan said the number of cases will spike, mirroring the situation in several cities and countries.

> The only hope then, he said, is that most of the population gets infected and becomes immune, and the rate of infection starts to slow down as more become immune, or a vaccine or a cure is found.

> But Mr Gan said this scenario has two risks: An uncontrolled spike in cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system and lead to high mortality rates. The second risk is that it is not certain yet that this immunity will be effective or sustained.

> 

> Therefore, Mr Gan said it still important to flatten the curve by detecting cases early and initiating contact tracing as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.

> Mr Gan said Singapore has been able to expand its contact tracing capacity due to additional manpower from public service agencies including the Singapore Armed Forces.

> LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY

> To complement their efforts, Mr Gan encouraged Singaporeans to download the TraceTogether mobile application to protect themselves and their families.

> The app uses Bluetooth to detect other users who come within close proximity for more than 30 minutes, enabling authorities to initiate a quicker and more accurate contact process if needed.

> Mr Gan also reiterated the importance of social responsibility and safe distancing, stressing that those who have been issued with a quarantine order or stay-home notice must remain at home.

> ""If you violate them, there will be penalties, and the greatest penalty is that you may infect others close to you,"" he said.

> 

> ""If you have been given a medical certificate, please stay home for the whole duration covered by the medical certificate.""

> 

> Mr Gan said he has observed a few local clusters emerge where individuals who were feeling unwell or on medical certificate did not minimise social contact and continued to attend work or social activities.

> ""Studies on COVID-19 have shown that for each ill person who behaves responsibly, we can protect two to three others from being infected,"" he added.

> ""For the young and healthy amongst us, we may get away with a mild cold or cough, but for our vulnerable loved ones around us, the disease may prove to be more serious.""

> 

> PROTECTING THE ELDERLY

> Of particular concern are the elderly, as Mr Gan encouraged them to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene like everyone else, and engage in more home-based activities rather than group activities.

> Singapore has suspended all senior-activities at community centres, residents' committees, Senior Activity Centres and other locations.

> Instead, Mr Gan said seniors can exercise at home with TV and online exercise programmes, as well as watch TV shows covering topics like singing and cooking conducted by celebrities and People's Association trainers.

> 

> ""Family members and caregivers of seniors should also take precautionary measures such as washing hands with soap and water before interacting with seniors, and refraining from visiting seniors if one is unwell,"" he said.

> 

> ""The measures we have put in place are extra 'brakes' to slow down the transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed, help bring the number of cases back down over time, and protect, particularly, our seniors.""

> 

> CLOSING THE EMOTIONAL DISTANCE

> Despite the need to maintain a wider physical distance, Mr Gan urged people to close the emotional distance between them.

> ""We should not stop caring about fellow Singaporeans or build walls between ourselves,"" he stated.

> ""On the contrary, we need to be more united than ever so that we can ride through this crisis together.""

=== Author: LaZZyBird===
Singapore balanced both practical constraints and disease prevention. This means that, given the relatively small population and in-depth information we have on our citizens, we are able to effectively seek out and isolate cases before they become a huge deal. It is not replicable anywhere else because, come on, the amount of civil servants per capita in Singapore is outrageous compared to any other country. That is one of the benefits of being a well-governed nation-state.

China, on the other hand, due to the draconian, all-mighty nature of the CCP, has no need to use nuance when it comes to dealing with the outbreak. Activate the army, lock down the entire city, start dragging away people when they disobey, silence information. Whereas one is a meticulous operation to try to minimise harm, the other is the equivalent of severing away an entire limb.

Besides, come on, China having zero cases. Literally close to zero? Serious? No doubting the effectiveness of the methods, but even Singapore still has sporadic local cases. Given how similar the corona virus is to the common flu, especially with regard to symptoms, I would not be surprised if more people in China get sick due to the ""seasonal flu"" in the coming months.

=== Author: pseudoduespp===
SG focuses more on aggressive contact tracing and as well as strong punitive measures (see: Infectious Diseases Act for the details) when quarantine or SHN is violated. Our government recognises that a complete national lockdown would be the worst outcome scenario and introduced staggered measures on public congregation in the initial phases (early Feb) to prevent panic in the general public.

Transparency, coupled with a general trust in the government's ability to cope with crisises has help contained the outbreak. That is, of course until the sudden rise in imported cases due to other countries not testing rigorusly and taking the outbreak seriously in the initial phases.

It differs from China as soon as the outbreak looked uncontrollable domestically (due to government they immediately imposed draconian measures to prevent citizens from even leaving their houses entirely. So sure, if one considers that basically stripping citizen's most basic rights is the only way to stop the outbreak, of course China's model is the best. In contast, in Singapore, we are showing that is entirely possible to contain a contagious virus without a complete lockdown and without the economy shutting down.(But of course right now, other countries can't contain it and so it spillovers to Singapore :/ )

=== Author: jinhong91===
China's method is to cover up until it's too big to cover and then clamp down with an iron fist (or iron bars for that matter).

All this could have been avoided had they looked into the whistleblower doctor (who died from the virus) who warned about this in December.

=== Author: rendangkecap===
Singapore is not following China’s methods at all. China locked down Wuhan and the rest of the Hubei province back in January when they had about 25 or so deaths. Singapore only just recently (within the past week or two) started isolating the country from overseas travelers because there’s been more imported cases than local transmissions in the last few weeks.

Singapore’s primary method since the start has been contact tracing and isolation of infected people as well as their immediate contacts. Up until now people are still free to get around the country on public transport although many offices have implemented work from home policy so the business centres have been empty for a little while. People still flock to malls and shopping centres though entertainment venues were told just last night to temporarily close.

You can read about Singapore’s response in more detail in [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51866102)

=== Author: jotunck===
China initially covered up and let everything go to hell, so we got praised for acting on it immediately and minimising the spread rate.

Once they realised they can't contain and cover up, China went into draconian control mode which is of course more effective than non-draconian methods, so now China is getting praise for it.

The methods worldwide are mostly the same few recommendations, social distancing, as much testing as possible, self-quarantine for people who are at risk, etc. The only difference is how obedient the people are / how tough the government is willing to crack down on disobedient people.

to be fair to your colleagues, china has dealt with problem for 5 months and if the current situation is right, china is the more proven model.

we want the singapore model to succeed, but at the moment, recommending this to other is risky when we are having 40 unlinked cases at the moment

the main difference between singapore and china, is that singapore has been getting away with less restriction, but it may now be showing that we are compromising on the spread of pandemic

Stop propogating this myth. 

The Lancet study clearly reports the first recorded case as December 6th. The first Cluster emerged around December 20 and visible human to human transmission was observed in late december as patterns emerge in wuhan. All this was in the NEJM paper. 

Whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang sends his message on the 30th. China was also investigating and reported to the WHO on the 31st about the novel disease. 
On Jan 2, China maps the genome of the virus and releases the results to the world the week after. 

I agree the the CCP isnt to be trusted 100%, but there is not much evidence to show that the Chinese covered things up at this point. Most of the media flogging that line are playing to the western rhetoric. Be careful what you read and I would hardly take western sources as the truth on China. 

Imagine if the US had found a novel virus on the eve of thanksgiving with everyone going home to their families. Remember this was happening right smack in between christmas and CNY. Yeah.... I dont think ANY government, let alone China's, is going to be imposing a quarantine for something they arent sure off yet, just before the biggest holiday of the year. 

This happened in a period where things are usually slow (christmas), with the seasonal flu making it hard to detect (winter). You think their response is going to be any better than Chinas?

We haven't had a straight up nationwide lockdown like what most countries have been doing, but rather, taking steps to enforce stricter measures which may or may not result in an ultimate lockdown. This is probably not to cause too much disruption to businesses and schools, and thus allowing businesses to stay open so the negative financial impact won't be that great.

=== Author: sianzzzzzzz===
Basically it means that sg is trying very hard to protect businesses so that there will be a reduction of retrenchment and businesses going bust. Ultimately you still need money during this crisis to survive right?

Finally some concrete measures being taken. Other countries all doing this already.

=== Author: sneakpeek_bot===
> # All entertainment venues in Singapore to close, gatherings outside work and school limited to 10 people, as fight against Covid-19 ramps up

> SINGAPORE - Bars, cinemas and all other entertainment outlets will be closed from Thursday (March 26) 11.59pm till April 30, as Singapore's fight against Covid-19 enters a new phase amid a wave of imported cases to the country.

> In announcing its strictest measures yet, the multi-ministry task force also said on Tuesday (March 24) that:

> * All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of students.

> * All religious services will be suspended.

> * Malls, museums and restaurants must reduce crowd density to stay open.

> * All Singapore residents returning from Britain and the United States from Wednesday (March 25), 11.59pm, will have to stay in hotels to serve their 14-day short home notice (SHN).

> * Those who breach the SHN will face enhanced fines of less than $10,000 or jail of less than six months or both.

> * Any Singapore resident or long term pass holder who leaves Singapore from March 27 will be charged unsubsidised rates should they be hospitalised in public hospitals for Covid-19 treatment.

> They also won't be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.

> The measures come as 49 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday, including 32 imported cases. This brings the total of patients to 558.

> The measures are pre-emptive but come at a time of real risk, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference.

> ""All over the world, millions of people are living in a different reality. Workplaces are closed, shops are empty, roads are empty, everyone is asked to stay home,"" he said.

> ""We are not experiencing this in Singapore but we cannot be complacent.""

> Despite efforts to isolate imported cases, the risk of local transmission will rise as Singapore sees more imported cases, he said.

> ""So we have to take seriously the measures to protect our family members and the people around us,"" he said.

> The measures on entertainment venues cover bars and entertainment venues like night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets.

> Other public venues such as retail malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open.But operators must make sure the venue does not have more than one person per 16 sqm of usable space .

> This is to significantly reduce the density of crowds in these venues, especially during peak periods, said the Ministry of Health.

> Groups must not exceed 10 persons. Indoor and outdoor shows within attractions and open atrium sales events are suspended.

> Retail malls and attractions that are unable to adhere to these requirements must be closed and additional penalties may be imposed on those found to have been a place of transmission if they had not adhered to requirements.

> The ministry said existing measures for food and beverage venues continue to apply. While related diners can be seated together at one table, tables must be spaced out.

> Groups of diners should also be limited to 10 persons or fewer.

> Patrons of places with fixed seating - for example, hawker centres - must use alternate seats.

> On religious gatherings, the ministry said that while services will be suspended, places of worship may remain open for private worship and essential rites, subject to group sizes of 10 persons or fewer at any one time.

I thought that the whole point of subsidising their treatment is to encourage people to report sick, so there won't be people hiding their illnesses because they want to save money.

But now that I think about it, those people who can afford to travel in times like this probably can fork out those fees, and they'd be subjected to even tougher enforcement of SHN in the coming future once they return.

I still think that preventing such folks from leaving is better.

=== Author: skatyboy===
I think it's damn fair for them to pay for their own controllable decisions. 

However, what's the consequence of not paying hospital bills? I know that hospitals don't generally sue you for outstanding bills or make you go bankruptcy proceedings. At most, the next time you need treatment, you can only go through B2/C wards. 

With cuts to outbound flights and bans/lockdowns, I think international tourism is as good as gone now. This is to catch those that still insist on going to countries that are still in denial (Indo, for example).

It's hard to be convinced that they are anywhere effective when the unmarked seats are still pretty damn near within an arm's distance, and like, everyone is pretty damn near each other anyway by design. Also, there have been reports that the virus can stay on surfaces for many hours, and this so-called distancing isn't going to work if not in tandem with frequent disinfection.

And then the number of seats gets halved on top of a flimsy poorly-enforced policy. Will be hard to expect people to give a fuck, because the idea just doesn't make sense.

=== Author: sangrilla===
Which they are pretending not to see. They are stopping gathering of more than 10 people, placing restriction on food outlet and shopping malls, events, entertainment outlet because of possible spread via crowd but is ok with the crowded trains and buses.

With all these measures, escalating to a more restrictive measures within a week, I wonder if there is a community spread that they are losing control and not telling everyone.

Reposting my comment from another thread:

One problem here is that the Singapore government isn't helping things by making it still possible to travel — this means that the [force majeure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure) clause in most flight/hotel bookings, or the trip cancellation clause in travel insurance (presumably bought before all the insurance companies stopped covering COVID-19) can't kick in.

=== Author: Butifutaki===
I swear the govt reads Reddit. The ideas are uncannily similar.

=== Author: retaki===
> I still think that preventing such folks from leaving is better. 

There are arguments on personal liberty etc if imposed.  (Onus is on govt, aka ""nanny state"")..

By imposing this penalty on cancelling subsidy, it still allow the individual to decide and to be responsible for one's action.  (Onus is on self).

&#x200B;

On another note, I observe many of these new measures are incremental/ experimental in some sense, since we don't exactly have a SOP for the current situation (which has deviated from SARS).

Sg is also taking slightly different approach vs other countries, so there is no one to learn from. So, the govt would not be implementing sweeping/big measures unless the situation calls for it.

=== Author: FitCranberry===
yes that is correct, any reduction in healthcare access will have further delays and spreads downstream, they are hoping that all this is captured within the 14 day window but we already stats that incubation may go beyond that so its a gamble to play stick instead of carrot

Can hospital forcefully take from CPF if someone is hospitalised in their old age? Or dies during hospitalisation?

I don't mean sharing tables, I mean individual groups sitting in tables side by side

=== Author: QzSG===
There is a huge difference between someone coughing in your face beside you vs someone coughing beside you one metre away, if standard observations are any indication, most people coughing or sneezing in coffeeshops will ""try"" to cover their mouths or noses, so a distance of at least 1.5 m even though not that safe, isn't something to underestimate.

On the surfaces thing, if people just stop freaking touching their faces and actually wash their hands regularly using proper hand washing techniques, that attack vector by itself is pretty much gone unless you suay suay want to know how the table smell like

Many things that are implemented do make sense, they only don't when you are already biased to think that way.

=== Author: FitCranberry===

Unpopular opinion here. Declare a week of forced stay home for everyone with minimum movement like Malaysia and see how it goes. There's nothing much to lose here. It will flatten out the infection curve well. Business can still operate minimally with people working from home or the critical supply chains with minimum resources. Just one week. That's it. Try and observe. Nothing much to lose.

=== Author: jdickey===
Most of the F&B outlets in Tampines Mall have put tape on alternate seats in an *X* pattern, along with signs on the doors and stickers on the tables asking people to practice social distancing. I was at the BK earlier when a group of 7 people came in and sat at one of the large tables (pulling a couple of extra chairs over). Curious, I asked if they were all related to each other and, if not, why they weren't following the social-distancing guidelines right there on the table. They said ""Oh, we work together"". I'm glad I don't work for a company that makes everyone come into the office during a pandemic, and I'm *especially* glad I don't work for whoever their employer is.

I would be very surprised if, within the next month or so, we didn't start hearing about clusters formed from workers in a single office who were neither permitted to work from home, had social-distancing policies enforced in the office, or given *and competently trained on* adequately effective personal-protection equipment.

Because too many companies will pay any price to cut costs, especially if it's only the low-level munchkins paying that price.

I mean, I understand medical workers, but what about teachers? If they get sick, oh well? What about the other kids? I mean, kids are not great at reducing the chances for spreading a virus. A school is a perfect place for a virus to spread on a large scale quite quickly.

**Force majeure**

Force majeure ( FORSS mah-ZHUR, -⁠mə-ZHUR; French: [fɔʁs maʒœʁ]) – or vis major (Latin) – meaning ""superior force"", also known as cas fortuit (French) or casus fortuitus (Latin) ""chance occurrence, unavoidable accident"", is a common clause in contracts that essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, plague, or an event described by the legal term act of God (hurricane, flood, earthquake, volcanic eruption, etc.), prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. In practice, most force majeure clauses do not excuse a party's non-performance entirely, but only suspend it for the duration of the force majeure.Force majeure is generally intended to include occurrences beyond the reasonable control of a party, and therefore would not cover:



Any result of the negligence or malfeasance of a party, which has a materially adverse effect on the ability of such party to perform its obligations.

Any result of the usual and natural consequences of external forces.

To illuminate this distinction, take the example of an outdoor public event abruptly called off.

Maybe, but it's also not really a stretch to know that using monetary disincentives is an effective way of getting (most) Singaporeans to not do something. Money speaks immense volumes in this country.

I mean, why are some people even travelling now? Because tickets and accoms are cheap! It's literally *everything* about the money.

=== Author: mantism===
Thing is, Singapore is already a nanny state, so I wouldn't be entirely surprised if that was implemented. Allowing for free, unrestricted travel is something I expect for other countries. 

Of course, with all these travel advisories, most sensible (and risk averse) people wouldn't even think of leaving the country, but it's always the stubborn ones that eventually spoil the pot.

=== Author: jdickey===
If I were in a high position in the government of a country explicitly not our friend, or an officer of a company that would profit from supplying *stuff* in an attempt by our Government to overcome panic buying, I'd have agents already in place here who could spread rumours that infected people *were* in such crowds; any naturally-occurring COVID cases would then spark even *more* anxiety among the people and more authoritarian (though entirely justifiable in context) actions by Government.

If I were high in *our* Government and had reason to believe we weren't employing counter-intelligence-type activities to find such malignant actors, I'd jump up and down demanding to know why, no matter how strong our the-top-is-always-right-by-definition indoctrination is.

I wouldn't expect such activities to be made public knowledge until they had been completed (and COVID was no longer a serious threat), but I *would* expect any Government that aspires to be taken seriously as running a developed country to make the details public after the *current* threat has passed. Not necessarily the detailed nuts-and-bolts operational details, but certainly full transparency on policy, alternatives considered and why they were rejected, and the results of such operations.

Do I expect *this* Government to do any such thing? I wouldn't bet any money on that proposition that I'd terribly mind losing...

=== Author: jdickey===
That's a problem, and entirely consistent with Singapore's 1930s command-and-control business psychology. As director of technology for a software startup here, our biggest problem hiring and retaining local development/devops hires has been an unwillingness or inability to look at things differently.

Once COVID has passed and borders open again, we're going to accelerate our plan to establish a dev centre/business presence in the Philippines so we can hire people there (who will generally be working remotely). I can get more high-quality senior/lead CVs within a couple of days of posting openings there than I can in a _quarter_ beating the drum trying to hire people here. Mindset is half the battle; a culture that doesn't equate imperfection with political/economic suicide is the other 99%. The real world simply no longer works that way, if it ever did in some long-ago era.

Work doesn't have to be in an office; in fact, working *not* in an office solves several problems for people and for societies (think of how wretched our roads like the PIE are; if half to two-thirds of traffic went away, competent maintenance would last much longer).

It *does* require a higher-degree of self-discipline and initiative than sitting in a command-and-control-driven office. Bosses and workers are going to have to become better at communication, for one thing; if fear is the mind-killer, then setting achievable goals and communicating efficiently with all stakeholders is something that modern tech was literally designed to facilitate. Learn what's out there and *experiment*. Accept that your org isn't going to get every detail absolutely perfect the first time; use techniques such as the five whys to drill down and identify, without blame, what could have done better and what some of the possibilities for doing that thing better are. Then do it again, communicating (at least within your org) profusely and effectively so that everyone understands what's going on and why.

Of course, that requires that companies treat employees as reasonably intelligent people with intellect and emotions and wants and needs, rather than as mere disposable ""digits"", to use LKY's term, that can be disposed of and replaced on a whim from an inexhaustible supply. We're no longer in a world that either supports an inexhaustible supply nor values the products that can be made by disposable people (and can be made better by robots); it would be very nice if we could adapt to that reality (and stand a better chance of surviving to see SG60, let alone SG100, in the process).

We're going to have to build up authentic communication; use that to build shared understanding; and then use both of those as a basis for trust. We've fought against that for our entire history as an independent nation, even as successful nations the world over have been embracing it. It's (long past) time for change.

There were a lot fewer of us then, living in smaller areas, and people trusted the Government then. (In no small part because ""who wouldn't like more money?"" wasn't yet the guiding principle of the Party.)

Now? We're told we're a ""first world country"" now, which implies standards of transparency and accountability that this Government is on record as having no intention of holding themselves to beyond *saying* they're immaculate, and having that parroted *ad infinitum* by Party media. Other countries with deeply flawed governments are starting to figure out that insisting on standards and policies isn't just a good idea, but would save lives. The 1930s strong-man model is a century or more out of date, and good riddance.

> # Stuck in Singapore: 24 hours with a Malaysian technician

> On March 17, as Malaysia prepared to close its borders amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Sumon Nuam and some 100,000 other Malaysian workers chose to rush back to Singapore. What is he trading off to continue working here?

> SINGAPORE: Sumon Nuam wakes up at 6am in a daze, his body clock rousing him on automatic. At this time on a usual day, he’d be waiting for the school van with his two daughters, aged 9 and 17, at the foot of their apartment block in Johor Bahru, before beginning his two-hour motorcycle ride to work in Singapore.

> Instead, this morning, he’s holed up at a budget hotel in Geylang, restless and awake two hours before he has to be anywhere.

> Work is now just a five-minute ride away. But in the grand scheme of things, it’s hard to see that as a blessing, when the family he’s missing might as well be on the other side of the planet.

>

> Three nights ago, on March 17, the 45-year-old technician joined thousands of fellow Malaysians rushing to cross the Singapore-Malaysia land border before a two-week lockdown took effect the next day, as part of Malaysia’s efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19.

> When news of the movement control order broke, Sumon was faced with a painful choice: Stay home with his family and forgo two weeks of salary (or possibly more, if the shutdown were to be extended) – or be separated from them for an unprecedented length of time.

> Sumon and his daughters Cherry, 9, and Christina, 17.

> It really was no choice at all. With the lockdown in effect, his wife’s mamak stall would have to shutter. The family needed his income.

> “I haven’t finished paying the installments on my house. There’s also electricity bills,” he says.

> As 8am finally swings around, Sumon gets ready for work in his hotel room. He nips down for breakfast at a coffee shop. The bread and coffee cost him three times more than the usual beehoon he buys on the way out of Malaysia.

> 

> Leaving his temporary lodgings in Geylang for his workplace in Kallang.

> 9AM-12PM: STARTING THE DAY’S WORK

> Sumon is a senior technician at OTO Wellness, where he has been handling after-sales service – such as fixing and maintaining the company’s massage and sporting products – for the last 20 years. His current team of three attend to an average of five customer requests a day.

> He parks his motorbike, and picks up the company van, the day’s order forms and the required equipment, before setting off for his first home visit.

> 

> Sumon and his partner en route to a customer's home.

> At the client’s place, Sumon works on the faulty machines swiftly. He knows instinctively where problems may lie and wields his tools with the efficient familiarity of someone in the skilled trade for two decades.

> 

> It’s no wonder that when the Malaysian lockdown was announced, company service manager Ng Kok Keong got anxious. “I was worried for (Sumon) but also for our work. If he went back, we would not have enough people to keep our operations running,” the 58-year-old said.

> Making a house call to repair a massage chair.

> Sumon is among four of their Malaysian staff who chose to stay in Singapore following the travel restrictions (a fifth had to return home to care for an ailing father). The others quickly found relatives or friends to put them up – but Sumon had no one.

> So Kok Keong drove around to look for a nearby hotel, and found him a room at Hotel 81 at S$80 a night, which the company is paying for. “We want our staff to be well-rested so that it does not affect their work,” said Kok Keong.

> “After all, they have left their family behind, so this is one worry we can take off their minds.”

> Working with the experience of 20 years at his trade.

> What’s uncertain is whether Malaysia might extend its lockdown, and for how long, given the country’s growing number of infections. Sumon’s company will review accommodation arrangements if the time comes. So far the Singapore Government’s S$50 allowance per worker per night, to help companies offset costs incurred during the two weeks, has helped.

> READ: Companies affected by Malaysia travel restrictions to get financial support: Josephine Teo

> 12PM-6PM: LUNCH & NEXT ROUND OF SERVICING

> Back in the office after the morning round, Sumon sneaks in a quick video call on his Oppo phone with his youngest daughter, Cherry. She turns nine today – and not being there for her birthday wrings an emotional moment from the normally phlegmatic Malaysian.

> Tears welling in his eyes, he says: “I feel sad thinking about her. We’re very close.”

> Indeed, on March 17 even as he was rushing home from work in order to pack his things and get back to Singapore before the deadline, the first thing Sumon did when he entered JB was to stop and buy a birthday cake for Cherry.

> “My daughter told me, ‘You cannot leave’. But I know she understands,” says the doting father. “They waited until today to cut the cake.”

> Soon after their lunch break, work beckons again and Sumon and his partner set off for several more home visits. While he has never been this long away from his wife and two daughters, he considers himself lucky that he still has an income stream.

> From March 24, Singapore barred all short-term visitors from entering, save for work-pass holders providing essential services such as healthcare or transport.

> 6PM-10PM: DINNER AND WINDING DOWN

> On days he didn’t have to work overtime, Sumon would start his journey back to JB at around 6pm, making it home by 7.30pm for dinner if there was little traffic at the checkpoint.

> This evening, he gets back to his empty hotel room in no time at all, and with no meal waiting for him. He winds down as he waits for one of his few friends here to finish work, so that they can have dinner together.

> Sumon on a video call with Christina, 17, before dinner.

> While idling, Sumon makes another video call home to his wife and daughters. It’s a Friday, and if he were back in JB, he’d be watching TikTok videos with the girls. On an ordinary weekend, he’d take them out shopping, or watch as Christina helped Cherry with homework.

> For now, though, watching them on a 6-inch screen will have to do.

> 8pm comes around and his friend, who packs powder at a factory in Jurong Island, can finally meet him. Mohd Fadli Tarzan, 27, stays just two streets away at another budget hotel arranged by his company.

> Sumon and Fadli at Geylang, where they are both staying for now in budget hotels.

> Fadli’s family lives seven hours away in Terengganu, so unlike Sumon he’s used to having been away from them for a long time.

> The two Malaysians talk until 10pm – after all, they have nowhere else to be. Finally, when tiredness creeps in, Sumon returns to his room and counts down the days yet again - to when he might, hopefully, finally, go home again.

NO. DEAD WRONG.  


GP sent her to A&E to get tested, after that point, she had to sit in one corner in the open and wait 1 hour for the ambulance to come.  


Her mom had to come back from work just to pass her phone charger and cable, IC and a bottle of water.  


HAVE A SMALL HOSPITAL BAG TO GO (Also,useful if you kena quarantine if your friend xia suay and met you when sick)  


1. ID - or copy of ID
2. Wallet
3. Phone
4. List of allergies, medications, medical history
5. Emergency Contact List
6. Phone Charger
7. Cables
8. Electronic devices - laptop, charger, tablet, charger, switch etc
9. Water (might be hard to get in ER)
10. Snacks
11. Jacket (ER's can get cold)
12. Change of Clothes
13. Personal toiletries - toothbrush, face wash, etc

Bit overkill. I would say phone, charger, earphones, wallet (IC, cash, cards), jacket. 

Too many electronic devices will hamper your recovery. What you need is sleep and rest. 

If you've got Covid you might also be weak/tired by then.

Can I also add on:

-  hair tie for those with long hair (need to have hair up for chest X ray)
- tissue (you will tear and have runny nose after swab)
- snack bars in case you get hungry during the 3-4 hour wait in ncid

Make sure your jacket is thick and you wear long pants. It's very cold in there.

Sorry, have to disagree. 

Essentials are item 1-5, 12, 13
In this outbreak, items 6, 7, 9, 11,14 are recommended and helpful

Items 7, 8 may be a bit too much. 

Rationale:
If you're gonna prepare such a hospital ready bag, it should be for any prolong stay in hospital. 

Laptop and WiFi are kind of modern day luxury, suitable for covid outbreak, but hardly for all kinds of admissions.

While wards typically have phones, most of us don't remember numbers much so that's why I still consider handphone essential.

Some A&E provide blankets in the waiting area. I'd still bring my own jacket, though.

This is good. I always bring my charging cable & a power bank with me wherever I go + wear mask when I go out now & have hand sanitizer in my bag, but the clothes and toiletries, switch etc will take note. Hopefully won't have to tho. Stay safe & healthy people!

>Life Pro Tip

Most abused term in modern vocabulary history. 

Relax, your health is more important. Just go to the AE, someone will bring these things, Its not like you are going to a secluded isolated resort and your holiday is spoilt as you forgot to bring some necessary things, 

Singapore is such as small country, a cab . MRT ride is so easy. Anyway family is still going to visit the hospital. 

Don't be a suaku or bukit with all those items packed in bag just to see your local GP. And why you need change mask, googles, sanitzer, water , going to an AE. Do you read the news about how such cases are handled. They are not sending you to a crowded Hawker Centre.

=== Author: there_I-said-it===
I don't know what the rules are in Singapore but in the UK if you go to the GP with covid symptoms you'll get the GP surgery temporarily shut down for disinfection and annoy a lot of people. Call first and check what the proper protocol is in your country before exposing a bunch of people...

You're very isolated in NCID so your family isn't allowed to see you directly. If they're also not in there getting tested that is. 

Also, if you're bringing your own items like masks and water and sanitizer, you reduce the burden on the hospital. With the spike in cases, resources are scarcer than ever.

It's best to be prepared.

That’s not reduced brain power, it’s knowing who your audience is, your environment is, and code switching to fit in so that you can get your message across more efficiently. You think if they speak like how they speak to their Ang moh colleagues the chao ah bengs begins will understand meh? Of course not! Must speak singlish with a mix of hokkien and throw in a few lame jokes to catch the attention of the audience.

I still won’t advise bringing it into hospital regularly . Theft still occurs and it’s one more expensive item to keep in mind. 

There are other activities to do post operation. Exercises to do, deep breathing exercises. Might I highly recommend reading a book. Cheaper if you lose it/gets stolen.

it isn't painful it's more uncomfortable! just like what ediblepetals said hahahah it makes you tear for sure. just tahan lo for 3-5 seconds. they use some tube looking thing abt 5cm long then will insert into ur nose into the sinus area. test results take about 24 hours to come out to see if you're positive/negative. but trust me, i'd rather have the swab than doctors draining blood out of my arm every few hours.

Why isn't the article reporting about the unlinked cases?

=== Author: FitCranberry===
hello, 17 local spread

=== Author: localinfluenza===
Actually I dont understand why Singapore has the highest import cases from UK. I believe China and Taiwan has more students studying in UK than us.

=== Author: jieqint===
Why did CNA not report on the 13 cases being untraced as of this report. [ST](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/49-new-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore-of-which-32-are-from-overseas) and [Yahoo](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-singapore-confirms-49-new-cases-including-32-imported-total-at-558-113148482.html) news both got mention...

=== Author: chenhankiang===
So many accumulated unlinked local cases now...where are the updates? No clusters?

Don't worry and let's take our time with implementing the necessary measures, because our window of opportunity is as long as the circumference of the earth.

Basically like the US where they went full denial and refuse to test and contain it. Now they have a full blown outbreak on their hands and are starting to do something.

[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-uk-response-to-coronavirus-playing-catch-up](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-uk-response-to-coronavirus-playing-catch-up)

I think this is a pretty accurate article to sum up their response so far. Have a read at it if you are interested.

According to my friends and relatives in the UK, they are taking a very relaxed approach to the COVID-1 situation. The government sent ""an advisory to reduce social gatherings"" but people are still going to pubs and traveling around as of last week.

Herd immunity, or the process thereof.

=== Author: adognow===
Criminal malfeasance by the UK government is what is going on.

There is a link between the swaggering behaviour of the US and the UK on the world stage to the explosion of their COVID numbers. Their numbers currently don't reflect it because they have not scaled up testing like other afflicted countries. Their governments are drunk on decades of delusions of exceptionalism and think that the control measures of 'lesser' countries don't apply to them. The French President had to threaten to close the border with the UK (a very credible threat that would mean consumer shortages in the UK) before Boris Johnson would EVEN acquiesce to basic epidemic control measures. He's a bastard.

It's fine if the Brits and the yanks want to kill themselves but they are exporting a vast number of cases worldwide. Singapore can (probably) absorb the fruits of their incompetence, but just think how many people are going to die in countries like Bangladesh or Nigeria because of all the cases going worldwide.

=== Author: lurkingaround08===
I don't think they have the capacity for further investigation just yet, given the recent spike in cases

>  why Singapore has the highest import cases from UK.  

Do you have source for the figures of their imported cases from UK?

=== Author: pieinabox===
It's partly because China has 3 categories according to their own guidelines - suspected, confirmed, and asymptomatic infection. Those in the last category will be subjected to centralized quarantine for 14 days, and only counted as ""confirmed"" when they develop symptoms. Check this out from the Wuhan Health Commission if you read Chinese  [http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020032310252](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020032310252)

The world would have been doomed if this started in the US instead of China. They are doing the exact same thing they did during H1N1, at least that one had lower mortality rate. This time round they had more then 2 months warning and they still messed it up

Really? Cause the govt just went on tv to tell people stop going out and stay at home

> thankfully chickened out halfway, 

I truly think they're going full herd immunity with this shit

=== Author: MagosBiologis===
""Herd immunity strategy"" is retarded. A disease epidemic is like a fire: it rapidly spreads through the tinder of a naive population, but consumes its own fuel and burns out, because it can't re-infect those who have recovered or died. 

""Herd immunity"" as a strategy is like saying, your house is on fire, and your strategy is for it to burn down, because once it's burned it can't catch fire. It's the natural self-limiting outcome of doing nothing. It's like calling ""mass deaths from starvation"" a strategy against famine.

=== Author: glashgkullthethird===
>Their governments are drunk on decades of delusions of exceptionalism 

This extends beyond coronavirus into all aspects of British politics imo

=== Author: Klubeht===
Can't believe their official number is only around 6k + cases or something when it's so clear it's obviously more. Guess it's a case of ostrich where if you don't test you find? What a joke honestly, they well and truly get the govt they deserve. UK looking like a 3rd world country with this level of incompetence and response honestly.

=== Author: Raphi_Ainsworth===
Killing millions to save billions.

=== Author: theblahking11===
I think govt machinery is probably stretched now focusing on imported cases and it is a significant amount of contact tracing and that's why there are no connections to be found. Worse is a lot of people still continue their lives as normal and if govt isnt able to trace and close cases it will be disaster soon. Govt should have mandated work from home rather than still playing wait and watch.

For Taiwan, their daily new cases are on the average of 20 (mostly imported). Though it did not state how many are from uk. The average imported cases are already less than 20 which is a lot lesser compared to SG liao.

It's not that. They know it's more, have said 50k previously. They're only testing people in hospital due to limited resources.

It kinda makes sense not to bother testing people who will recover fine at home when you can't contain.

I thought it's 44. But yea 13 cases is the biggest spike of local unlinked cases. Troubling. Indicative of community spread.

=== Author: skatyboy===
I kinda don’t trust China’s numbers, given how willingly they fudged the numbers during the start of the epidemic. I have a hunch they are also fudging the end of the epidemic, so that they have excuse to restart lives in places like Hubei.

> # Pasir Ris D’Resort to become isolation facility for Covid-19 patients who are well but still test positive

> Some recovering Covid-19 patients will be moved out of hospitals to a “Community Isolation Facility” at D’Resort in Pasir Ris, from Tuesday, Mar. 24.

> The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced this in a press release issued on Mar. 24.

> On Tuesday, 49 new Covid-19 cases were also announced, bringing the total number of cases to 558.

> Patients to be isolated and receive medical care

> The patients will continue to be isolated at the facility, which has a capacity of about 500 persons.

> They will also receive medical care there, although these patients “do not generally require significant medical care”, as these patients are “clinically well enough to be discharged from medical care” even though they still test positive for Covid-19.

> MOH said that the facility is modelled after existing Government Quarantine Facilities, though the staff there would observe “a higher baseline level of infection control”.

> MOH also said that the cost of being isolated in the Community Isolation Facility would be borne by the government.

> Legal requirement to remain in isolation facility

> Patients sent to the isolation facility will be served with an “isolation order”, which legally requires them to remain in the facility and isolate themselves, MOH’s Director of Medical Services Kenneth Mak said, at a press conference on Mar. 24.

> Mak explained that the isolation order would be the “equivalent of a quarantine order”, issued to ensure that these patients remain in the facility and respect the rules.

> He added that the isolation order would be lifted when the patients no longer test positive for Covid-19 infection, and are deemed fit to return home by doctors.

> Previous policy of hospitalising all cases “not efficient”

> Previously, all patients were hospitalised, which MOH explained was to help with understanding of the disease, as well as to isolate Covid-19 patients.

> However, this has not been an efficient use of hospital resources, MOH said on Mar. 24.

> Thus, setting up the Community Isolation Facility would help to ensure that healthcare facilities in Singapore are able to cope with “a possible surge” in cases.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong had previously said that Covid-19 patients who required less support could potentially be housed in alternative facilities, instead of being hospitalised, at a press conference on Mar. 18.

> Gan also said that approximately 80 per cent of the people who were hospitalised required minimal health support.

> # 'It always helps when you know you are not alone': Freelancers rally online after taking hit from COVID-19 outbreak

> SINGAPORE: With the exception of a gig in April, lighting designer Jim Chan's work calendar is now completely blank as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

> ""Ever since the Chinese New Year period, a lot of things have been cancelled,"" he told CNA. ""Around that period, I started looking for other things to do. But I realised some people still wanted to carry on their shows, so I didn't commit to any other job because I still had to do these shows.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""Then when the Government announced that there would be a ban on events over 250 (people), everything got cancelled. That was just last week, so now I have to rethink (my plans) again.""

> While Mr Chan also had another role editing sports broadcast content, opportunities have also dried up as sports events have been largely postponed or cancelled.

> ""The main thing is the uncertainty - when this will end. I feel like if it ended in a month, I'd be fine, I'd be prepared enough and keep my finances in order,"" said Mr Chan, who estimates he has lost more about S$4,000 in earnings.

> ""But if this goes on for six months, then I will be in some trouble, I need to find something (else) to do.""

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> With the COVID-19 outbreak impacting many freelancers such as Mr Chan, a Facebook group for freelancers in the arts and culture and creative sectors has ben set up.

> Mr Chan has helped with the lighting for performances at festivals such as Textures 2020. (Photo: The Arts House at The Old Parliament Facebook page)

> The group, which has over 3,800 members, aims to rally these individuals, allow them to share job postings, and collect feedback which then can be shared with various stakeholders.

> The idea is also raise the profile of a sector which is often overlooked, said Mr Nicholas Chee, who created the group last month.

> ""What we've done is essentially to come together and say, look, there's a whole group of freelance professionals, self employed persons that are in this industry in these various sectors,"" he said. ""And a lot of them have have been affected by COVID-19 just like any other industry, because it's always (been talk) about tourism, hotels, things that you can see.""

> Mr Chee, who works in the media sector, estimates that the COVID-19 outbreak has cost him upwards of S$50,000.

> ""I think the most important thing is that this is the very first time ... that this sort of self organisation is happening,"" he added. ""I would say that if the group didn't exist, then everybody would just be venting on (their) home page.

> ""But what the group does is actually to give everybody a sense of emotional and mental support as well, to know that I'm not the only one in this terrible state ... When you have support from people around which are in the same in the same state, there's a lot of encouragement going on. And there's a lot of positive things going on and people are trying to make things happen in spite of the situation.""

> ""I've found some interesting things that I didn't know about,"" he said. ""You get to read stories about how different people are handling it, how different people are coping with it - whether they try something new, or take their business online.""

> Actress and writer Jo Tan is another freelancer who has been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak. She has seen productions, as well as hosting gigs cancelled, resulting in losses of around S$15,000.

> ""I might be writing a script and then at the next moment, nobody is going to see it, I could be rehearsing and developing a piece of work and nobody might be able to see that, I might not get paid as well,"" she said.

> ""I'm always fully aware that it might amount to nothing.""

> And while she tides over this difficult period, the Facebook group has been a help, whether it be providing support or starting projects that eventually can be monetised.

> ""It always helps when you know that you are not alone. And you can just rant. I do feel that there is solidarity,"" she explained. ""When you are the lone freelancer, it can feel like it's you against the world. But when you have a community then you know you have these people to back you up.""

> Earlier this month, the Government unveiled measures to help freelancers affected by the coronavirus outbreak. These include an allowance of S$7.50 an hour for self-employed persons when they attend courses under the SkillsFuture Series over the next three months.

> 

> There is no cap to how much training self-employed persons can sign up for under the scheme, which will be administered by NTUC.

> But freelancers say more can be done.

> ""I'm grateful for the SkillsFuture credits and the training allowance, but I also think there are some flaws,"" said Ms Tan, who pointed out that some courses are expensive.

> ""Everybody has no income now and needs to spend their training credits wisely. And we certainly can't afford to top up any deficiency in the credits with cash,"" she explained.

> ""Also, there is a training allowance for certain SkillsFuture courses which is great, but the current courses available for the allowance are really extremely limited and are in areas that would be a massive leap for many people to jump into.

> ""Like looking at these subjects, even if I went for like a full course, I'm still so distant from most of them that I would be far from qualified to work in that industry.""

> 

> More resources needs to be allocated to support the arts industry, added Ms Tan.

> ""For the arts industry in Singapore, It's been such a long slow journey to get to where are are today, where people from different parts of the world know of and respect our work,"" she explained. ""But if we don't have the resources to get through this period, we may have to start from zero again.""

> 

> In conjunction with the Facebook group, the website Ilostmygig.sg was launched on Monday (Mar 23). Inspired by similar efforts in the US and Australia, the website collates information on the losses suffered by those within such industries and hopes to give a sense of the scale of income lost.

> Ms Jo Tan performing in a production. (Photo: William Low)

> As of 6.33pm on Tuesday (Mar 24), the tally of lost income on the website stands at about S$18 million.

> 

> ""Now their losses are not invisible, there's a tangible number put to it,"" explained Mr Keith Tan, who was part of the team that helped to spearhead the website. ""It's real people submitting their numbers.""

> Users who enter the site can make use of a form to provide information, and moderators help to collate this information and form an overall tally. Checks are also done, to make sure that the numbers declared are in line with what is reasonable.

> ""When you engage with the Government, trade organisations, you can't just go to them and say: 'We're hurting and we're bleeding.' They will say: 'How much?',"" said Mr Tan.

> 

> ""Nick has already gone through several town hall meetings and conversations with the Government and trade organisations. So I think in the next dialogue, we have some data to bring to them,"" said Mr Tan. ""This is not a crowdfunding campaign - there's no intent to fulfil the tally, but it's to make aware that this is a real thing and this is the gross losses on the table. Now how do we tide this industry over till times are good again?""

> There are also various tabs for easy access to resources and the latest news. The website provides an ""I want to help"" tab, which is aimed at connecting external parties with freelancers in order to provide possible job opportunities.

> ""There are people who want to get involved and want to help. But the thing is that they don't know how to get involved,"" said Mr Tan. ""It's very important for people who want to help to have a channel to voice out how to want to do so, so that we can direct them to the relevant parties.""

MerRyanSG,COVID-19 will be a psychological battle soon due to social distancing....,0,fom7xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fom7xp/covid19_will_be_a_psychological_battle_soon_due/,16,1585150407.0,"I feel we are suddenly going too far with the social distancing measures....

(The Panasonic canteen was the last straw tbh)

The increased lack in physical distance is likely to lead to feelings of isolation. The lack of intimacy will also cause relationship problems. As humans, we use a lot of talking and venting to deal with our emotional problems - that's why gathering of men to drink beer, women sharing gossips...

Also, the fluidity of changes in policy dealing with COVID is starting to cause uncertainty - I know the government doesn't have a choice though.

If not managed well, before we even clear COVID, there might be a spike in mental health concerns. Depression and anxiety is going to set in - IMH should already start preparing the capacity.

Granted now it is still a novelty, but seems the situation will lead to months.

COVID-19 is not just about physcial disease. I hope the government would not be so short-sighted and also plan for psychological health and balance as well. 

Probably we need mental health professionals to step in to advocate for more balanced strategies.

Didn't the Singapore Psychological Society posted something related to mental health and COVID recently? Probably they should step in to advocate for a more balanced enforcing of social distancing, for eg still ok amongst closed ones, but more wary about new contacts.",2020-03-25 23:33:27,"

I think the emphasis right now is to slow the spread of infection rather than psychological wellness now that it’s a pandemic and citizens are returning from affected countries. The priority is to make sure that even if there are new cases, it’s not at a rate that will incapacitate the healthcare system which will highly likely lead to more deaths. Although one can argue that psychological defence is part of total defence. We have to stand together as a nation and brave this challenge.

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Yes but not for the general public, psychological resources should first be provided to healthcare worker, those out of jobs and financially affected by this.

=== Author: pannerin===
no we will spread messages on how to manage anxiety and worry. the government will also have to ensure that people's needs are taken care of economically

=== Author: 5k1u30zp===
Uhh really? Like keeping distance from others, no handshake, no hugging makes you lonely? No one's really stopping you from spending time with others, just less close contact.

As a guy who's single for several years, I don't miss handshakes with other dudes, pretty sure no one misses mine either. For me it barely makes a difference.

Agree with OP that psychological defence needs to be up as well. It's simply not sustainable to be on high alert all the damn time. Govnt can do psychology defence campaign to run concurrently with the physiological measures. Healthcare workers burnout is also very real and must be managed. This will be a prolonged battle so both mental and physical wellbeing are equally important.

=== Author: MerRyanSG===
can walk together... can be parallel rather than serial

=== Author: MerRyanSG===
It has to be balanced.

We need mental health professionals to step in to advise how to satisfy our psychological needs during this difficult period. For example, we can still keep within our communities, our families, still keep in phone contact with friends, creative ways of mingling.

Except the second bit (based on your examples) is right now in opposition to the first. There are plenty of ways to be social and maintain relationships without the need for direct physical presence.

**Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases**    
 

8. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.    
 

9. As of 24 March 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 8,822 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 2,803 are currently quarantined, and 6,019 have completed their quarantine.

Yesterday, i am sure there were 31 unlinked cases. If so, that is great news! We can always count on the contact tracers and medical staff.

yesterday was 31 unlinked, so I guess they are managing to find links but don't have the bandwidth to update the press releases. the contact tracing team must be really stretched now.

> # People with COVID-19 are ‘most infectious’ in first 7 days after developing symptoms: NCID consultant

> What have doctors in Singapore learnt about the new coronavirus, two months after the first patient was identified here? CNA speaks to NCID consultant Dr Wong Chen Seong to find out.

> SINGAPORE: Since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was announced in Singapore on Jan 23, health experts here have “learnt quite a lot” about the virus including when infected people are the most infectious.

> 

> Dr Wong Chen Seong, a consultant at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) told CNA in an interview on Monday (Mar 23) that the first week is when the viral levels “are at the highest” in an infected person’s respiratory secretions.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This means secretions from the nose and mouth produced when people cough, speak or sneeze, Dr Wong said.

> 

> After that, the viral level drops in the second week, which indicates that patients are “most infectious” in the first week, he added.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> This is why the message by the authorities has been that if you have any symptoms, seek medical attention, Dr Wong reiterated.

> 

> “If you’re given a stay-home notice or asked to stay home on medical certificate, just stay at home. Avoid contact with people unnecessarily.”

> 

> Dr Wong was also asked if patients here have experienced the loss of the sense of smell, also known as anosmia, given that British healthcare experts flagged this as a symptom for COVID-19 infections last week.

> To this, he said: ""We have heard reports, especially from overseas, of patients losing their sense of smell.

> 

> ""We've had a few patients here at NCID who have reported such symptoms as well. But as to how common it is, we don't really have a clear idea of that yet,"" the consultant added.

> 

> What, then, should people do if they are living with someone who may be symptomatic of the virus? This is especially since many who have worked or travelled overseas return to Singapore, and are issued a stay-home notice or leave of absence order to follow.

> 

> Dr Wong advised people to maintain really good personal hygiene at home.

> 

> The person who is displaying symptoms of the virus should isolate themselves in their own room as much as possible. In shared spaces, make sure good hand hygiene is practised and avoid sharing cutlery or food, he said.

> 

> He also gave a message to Singaporeans who may be feeling anxious and uncertain over the ongoing pandemic outbreak: “These are uncertain times and they are quite scary times as well, but we’ve gone through difficult times in the past, and we will get through this.

> 

> “But we can only get through this if we go it together.”

My gp even said I better go to A&E if my chest really hurts or I have a really hard time breathing, that way I have a much better chance.

Went to a polyclinic with a 1 week cough. Doctor said nothing seemed wrong and gave me 2 days Mc and medication. Cough still hasn’t improved till now ._.

=== Author: chenzinc===
Have 2 symptoms (fever is basically confirmed), and they will basically rush an ambulance down to you for testing. Happened at the workplace to someone, results out within the day.

=== Author: ballsie995===
chest hurts and hard breathing (if for long time)... you should really go to a&e. 

nothing to do with covid19. they probably wouldnt test you for it. but there are a ton of big concerns (cardiac) with that 2 symptom. 

lastly paranoia, and the constant negative pressure could take a toll on the body — physical manifestation.

=== Author: KAME_KURI===
chest pain can be indicative of something serious, even if it isn't covid-19

If it gets unbearable you should consider visiting A&E

=== Author: seeyou-bye===
Basically you need a fever to get tested for covid. If not, they already have a lot on their hands so probably won't send you for testing randomly. I would think your chests pains etc. are symptoms for another issue that should be tested. Unlikely to be covid though, you just got caught up in all these and develop hypochondriasis.

Strange. One of my additional duties now is to call the ambulance service for suspect cases. I had a couple of cases where they was no fever nor travel/contact. Ambulance will come and send you to another restructured hospital instead of NCID but you will still be brought in as a COVID suspect.

=== Author: haikallp===
I don't know why you're getting downvoted when you're saying the truth. Oh wait, its the reddit hive mentality. Seems illogical to assume you have covid just because of a cough. Unless you have two or more covid symptoms of course or have been in contact with someone's who tested positive.

=== Author: chenzinc===
Not sure why you're being downvoted to hell, but isolate yourself - if you're employed, ask to stay home (you should get 5 day MC from GP) - if you don't catch a fever within the 5 day period it seems like you should be in the clear for covid at least. Get well soon!

Best not to lie to the doctor because lying may land you into hot water (especially if they refer you in the end).

=== Author: Jammy_buttons2===
Please don't lie to your doctor. Just tell him/her that you suspect you may have it. Possible to get tested or not since you already came back thrice

=== Author: EarthwormJane===
If your chest discomfort/pain is really so bad that you woke up crying, you should be going to the A&E immediately regardless of all other symptoms. Wear a mask and just go to the A&E. What would you do if you had these issues but Covid wasn't a thing? You'd do just that, yeah?

Chest pains, cough, headaches, etc are also symptoms of other diseases, not just covid. When you go to the A&E, you'll get a blood test, chest x-ray, and possibly an ECG. An FBC combined with a CXR will be enough to rule out covid or if the results are ambiguous, you'll then be tested for it. It could very well be a bacterial infection or influenza. They still exist. Both of which are easily diagnosed with the few tests above.

NCID is not the one and only healthcare facility that tests for covid. All restructured hospitals have the capacity for testing and housing these patients.

=== Author: TryinaD===
I thought downvote only for irrelevant shit what

=== Author: skatyboy===
I’m not sure, but I know a majority of people don’t get swab tested. I also understand why, with limited testing capacity and whatnot. Maybe it has to do with symptoms, but I honestly don’t know, I didn’t want to hang around with a crowd of people that may be sick.

Chest pain may not be covid19 but something else. If bad, go a&e

=== Author: CCVork===
Did the GPs do xray on you btw? I know this is like playing internet doctor but just a bit concerned cos recently my brother got chest pain, got an xray done at polyclinic, then was advised to go A&E right away, and confirmed that he had collapsed lung out of nowhere and later required surgery. He seemed healthy before that other than the pain and cough.

Wrt covid, they didn't test him. Only when they had to transfer him to another hospital, they did as part of procedure.

=== Author: EarthwormJane===
Its ok to just go even now. But if you feel like it has resolved on its own, that's even better! Don't worry, it will all be ok. Just remember that covid is not the only diagnosis for these symptoms. Feel free to pm me if you need any guidance!

=== Author: CCVork===
I'm not sure why you're assured by that alone because I'd want an xray done if I were you even if just for peace of mind, but all the best. My brother is young too. The condition is prevalent in young (thin) males for some reason.

=== Author: matthew5025===
Please go back to the same doctor...

Huh you switched doctors? Should have stuck to one. Anyway just go to the A&E and tell the doctors there your full medical history

Same, but in this situation? Hard

=== Author: TryinaD===
Yes, same clinic still but different doctor on duty

=== Author: TryinaD===
Not switch, different person on duty in same clinic

=== Author: CCVork===
It's not, i just said my brother got it done during covid. Go somewhere with an xray like polyclinic and hospital and you'll see if it's hard.

=== Author: TryinaD===
Well, honestly they didn’t even recommend it, bc w an inhaler I basically did fine (no history of asthma)

=== Author: CCVork===
I don't think my message is getting across. If you believe GP can rule out conditions like collapsed lung without xray, when both the polyclinic and A&E had it done to produce the diagnosis, then I'll leave you to it. Covid isn't the only thing to worry about.

Edit: missed keyword xray

> # Covid-19: S’pore temple puts up barriers for safe distancing measures

> Mosques and certain churches in Singapore have suspended their services as part of their measures to curb the spread of Covid-19.

> The ministerial task force has also implemented a limit of 250 people for all gatherings, and for public establishments to set up safe distancing measures of at least one metre apart for customers or visitors.

> Temples put up safe distancing measures

> While temples have not had any reported infection clusters, they are to abide by these measures as well.

> The Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple at Waterloo Street, or better known as the Si Ma Lu Temple, has set up measures to ensure its worshippers pray in safe distances.

> Signs have been demarcated on the temple floors to indicate where people should stand to pray, so that they are at least one metre apart from each other.

> Red tape barriers have also been placed to prevent people from crossing over and coming in contact with other people easily.

> Some Facebook users have joked that the temple looks somewhat like an airport check-in counter, thanks to the barriers put in place.

> Other measures taken

> According to some visitors, worshippers are not allowed to kneel during this period, as part of safe distancing measures as well.

> In addition to the safe distancing measures taken, the temple has also suspended the use of fortune sticks (also known as “qian”) to reduce the use of shared items.

> While it seems that the temple still has a sizeable number of visitors, it is a far cry from its usual numbers, often with long queues waiting to enter.

> Stay safe.

> # Recovering Covid-19 patients sent to Mt Elizabeth Hospital, freeing beds in public hospitals for sicker patients

> Singapore - Twenty-nine patients recovering from Covid-19 were transferred from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases to a ward at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Orchard Road on Monday (March 23).

> These are patients who are no longer sick, or who need less medical care, but are still shedding virus. They will be discharged once they are confirmed clear of the coronavirus and no longer risk spreading the disease.

> It is the first of the four Parkway hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients from the public sector, said Dr Noel Yeo, senior vice-president of Parkway's Hospital Operations in Singapore

> He said: ""Our other three hospitals - Gleneagles, Mount Elizabeth Novena and Parkway East Hospitals - have also been put on alert to receive more of such patients in the future.""

> The move is to free public hospitals so they can take care of the more seriously ill Covid-19 patients. The number of new infections, especially imported ones, has been fairly high as residents return from high infection countries.

> There are now more than 300 Covid-19 patients in hospital.

> Dr Yeo said these are not the first Covid-19 patients to be treated at a Parkway hospital, although they are the first to be transferred from the public sector.

> ""Prior to this, we have already been actively managing Covid-19 patients in several of our facilities,"" he said. Two Indonesians infected by the coronavirus had flown into Singapore and gone to Gleneagles for treatment.

> There are a still handful of other Covid-19 patients at its other hospitals.

> Obstetricians at Parkway East have expressed concerns that the ward for the Covid-19 patients is on the same floor as the maternity ward.

> But Dr Yeo said: ""The same stringent safety protocols and precautionary measures will apply for these new patients, who will be housed in a single ward at the hospital.""

> Related Story SGH sets up fever screening area in carpark as cases spike

> These patients will not be allowed to leave the ward, nor are they allowed any visitors.

> All staff working in areas where the patients are must don protective apparel.

> He added that the areas these patients passed through during the transfer will be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.

> Dr Yeo said: ""We have been working closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on joining the national effort against Covid-19, and how private sector resources may be utilised to alleviate the load on public healthcare institutions.""

> He added that he hopes other private sector hospitals ""will also rise to the call and play their part to complement these efforts.""

> Last week, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong assured that Singapore has sufficient healthcare facilities and workers to cope with the current number of Covid-19 patients.

> He said there are also contingency plans if numbers go up.

> Associate Professor Kenneth Mak had added that MOH was exploring working with the private healthcare sector.

> Prof Mak, director of Medical Services at MOH, added that there is already a good relationship between the public and private sectors with past collaborations.

Sorry my advice was for those who use plain slices bread.

> # Khaw Boon Wan: Avoid peak-hour travel, don’t talk on public transport in Covid-19 season

> Cut down unnecessary travels, don’t talk or talk softly while on buses and trains, and avoid travelling on public transport during peak hours.

> These are some ways Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan wants Singaporeans to consider adopting in a bid to substantially reduce peak hour demand.

> Cut down unnecessary travel

> Speaking at a tour of the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) station Bright Hill on Monday (Mar. 23), Khaw urged commuters not to use public transport if they’re sick and to wear a mask and see a doctor instead.

> He also asked commuters to cut down on unnecessary travel during this Covid-19 season.

> Public transport commuters should also try not to talk at all, or softly if they need to, he continued. “Let the commuters have a quiet journey,” he said.

> Employers here can also assist with tackling peak-hour demand by implementing staggered working hours, flexible work timings and telecommuting.

> “In fact, by saving traveling time, we have more time to do work,” said Khaw, who also voiced his hope that flexible work arrangements can become a permanent fixture post-pandemic.

> “This will also reduce peak-hour demand and the pressure on us to add more trains and more lines. This will also save taxpayers a lot of money,” he said.

> TEL Stage 2 on track to open in 2020

> Meanwhile, the second stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (which Bright Hill station is a part of) is on track to open this year.

> The first stage of Thomson-East Coast Line — Woodlands North, Woodlands, and Woodlands South — will close earlier and open later on the weekends from Apr. 3 to Jul. 26, 2020.

> These stations will close at 10pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sunday.

> They will start service at 6.30am on Saturday and Sundays.

> This is to facilitate testing of all nine stations on Stages 1 and 2 of the TEL.

> Stage 2 of the TEL comprises six stations (Springleaf, Lentor, Mayflower, Bright Hill, Upper Thomson, and Caldecott) and is expected to benefit more than 60,000 households.

Exactly, I work earlier before the so called ""7:30am-8:30am rush hour"" and train is still like sardines.

I take a 6am train, daily.

Purely population density, dependence on PT, social distancing = impossible. I'd really like to be optimistic and think of scenarios to curb that, but not really seeing an actionable solution.

It should be staggered in 20mins interval. The train from 10-10:30am is pretty empty because nobody starts work at that time.

If we were truly concerned about aerosol transmission and want to reduce droplets in the air, we would advise everyone to wear masks instead of just those that are sick.

Not talking would help, but coughing and sneezing would still be an issue. 

Wearing a washable mask, scarf, or bandanna is better than no mask at all [according to studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic).

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
That depends on how much demand is reduced. If you've ever taken a train during off peak hours, it is crowded by students, housewives, tourists(which will be less now), and people who need to move around for their work (e.g. insurance/property/salespeople). 

You have some breathing room but the social distance recommendation can go out the window unless you get lucky or are near the end of the line. 

If anything, we would need *more* trains not less.

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
Yes, any mask is better than no mask at all. If surgical masks are in short supply, a reusable cloth mask will help to prevent infections [as studies have proven](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic).

=== Author: GaPe667===
pri school dun even have AM PM. 7.30am-1.30pm

=== Author: reddct===
Agree. It's a layered defence, each step - mask, distance, no talking - helps a little. That's my issue with the messaging over the mask. instead of being more upfront with the scarcity and the prioritising of them for our frontline and healthcare people, the G elects to not talk about it or downplay what help it does offer for a regular person. 

Mobilising the seamstress, tailors and DIY community to help with the making of reusable masks would have been a useful initiative.

I recently saw a mom posted on Facebook against the school closure because she has 4 kids in school, and only 2 PCs. She was asking if anyone have a spare laptop to lend them, she has trouble with various log ins required, and some of the schedule clashes so she couldn’t manage 3 out of 4 kids having to be online at the same time, not to mention her wifi is not strong. Damn, I feel her plight just reading that. I volunteered to lend her my own laptop as I’m currently WFH and have my work MacBook. But I totally understand where she’s coming from too.

I'm so 50 50 on this subject, I really see from both ends the arguments.
Should be interesting to note, a few of the bigger named International schools here UWC, SAS, CIS....

It's not an easy and black and white action.

As a sec 4 student this year, I really do not want school to close. It's honestly going to be really annoying and even of they close school it's not like they will make up for it somehow.

Schools are already taking precautions to reduce the risk of spread of the virus so I feel like there isn't really a need to close schools cause it will probably cause more harm then good.

if they finish their homework make sure they have a mandatory 6 hours revision. this way, it’ll really ensure that they won’t have time to do anything else besides sleeping and studying. better yet, if they can save time eating by studying at the same time, can bring forward. how much time they spend showering would depend on how much time they spend eating

This, so much. It's so easy to call for e-learning for students but there's still so many households out there who do not have even one computer at home, or even wifi, especially the low-income families. And when both parents have to work hand-to-mouth otherwise there's no food for their kids, there won't be parental supervision at home to guide the children with the online learning.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
International schools are at a much bigger risk. The siblings of the children there mostly go to foreign uni, so they are all coming back and could potentially spread it to their sibling, who then goes to school. Furthermore, int schools have liability so

=== Author: pingmr===
A really good reason to keep schools open is that if children are sent back home, healthcare workers who have kids now have to worry about what to do with their kids, as opposed to actually fighting the virus. 

If we close schools, the Government needs to also provide child care arrangements for this critical group.

I am not a student anymore, but this seems pretty reasonable to me? IF (which is unlikely to happen unless the situation deteriorate further), school closes for 1 month due to Covid, I think it is perfectly reasonable to cut short the June holidays by 1 month? It is just like, bringing forward the June holidays by 3 months, yeah for sure its worse-off since you not supposed to go out and stuff during this 1 month, but its not entirely unreasonable too. Seems pretty justifiable.

Idk. It is a state of emergency. No one wants holiday rn... if u can even call it "" holiday ""( stuck at home, limited supply, u could be sick,etc) . Every other country in the world aint reducing their summer vacation... why is it so important in singapore? Cant they just increase school hours by like 30 mins or implement online school, if anything. Going to school in summer also ruins loads of people's plan , be it vacation or study related

=== Author: RazeXIX===
Oh.. my friend in seoul told me otherwise ( maybe cause they are international school?).
Edit: just searched up.. what u said is not true. Schools have gone online. Regardless, there was never any plan to prepone school ( though it would make sense since sk is one of the other school is the most importsnt thing country - their students are hella over worked and depressed)

=== Author: OkieDokieLitClub===
Were u originally fro Sgforums?

=== Author: RazeXIX===
That assumption is invalid imo. Its just a flimsy excuse. Rn most parents dont let their kids go out.. or  the kids themselves are smart enough. They form a statistical minority ( less than 5%). My school has had holiday since last week ( btw vacation not reduced), and everyone is stuck inside)

=== Author: Pinkerino_Ace===
Yeah, I agree with you. I am not justifying closing school because, we were all student once, closing the school now = LAN parties.

I am not so sure what you are pointing out with the ""teachers are also parents"" though? If school are closed for 1 month during this period, technically teachers also have a break of 1 month during this period, no? Technically they also have their break brought forward.

 Also, why is this exclusive to ""teachers need a break too""? There are doctor parents, engineer parents, bus driver parents. They wouldn't even be entitled to the ""school holiday break"" either.

=== Author: Pinkerino_Ace===
Funny how you are so confident in saying ""every other country in the world aint reducing their summer vacation"". You have any evidence on that? If Singapore do reduce our summer vacation because of Covid, it will likely be only be posted on local newspaper like Straits Times and local news portals. Same to other countries like Japan, Korea etc.

I find it quite unlikely that such a ""localised"" news and arguably quite a minor issue compared to other global issues will be reported internationally. So unless you track every single country local news, how would you know ""every other country in the world aint reducing their summer vacation""?

I initially thought the same as u. But it turns out that during state of emergency, atleast in europe and usa , they arent allowed to reduce summer vacation. They do , however , have their school day extended. But since we have access to online school now, it seems they arent doing that.

I am not speculating. I have friends who stay there.. and i searched it up.

Experience. As i said, i have off rn and all my friends are at home. And this is sg, children listen to their parents( even usually most children dont go out.. that should be obvious)

If there are no social diatancing measures in place, obviously people will not think to stay home. It isnt just children.. rn everyone is out. We need stricter action.. u cant blame chileren specifically rn.

=== Author: Pinkerino_Ace===
Well, but you are making a pretty bold statement by saying “every country ain’t reducing summer vacation”.

So because ur older than me ur assumptions are more reliable than my observations?

I guess some of us will be curious about pilots' salaries now.

&#x200B;

>**Salary**  
  
>  
>Salaries vary depending on the type of aircraft a pilot is assigned to fly and the number of hours flown. Advancement of a pilot’s salary also depends on his length of service with the company and the fleet he belongs to. A First Officer’s basic salary starts from S$6,175 while a Captain’s starts from S$11,550.  
  
>  
>**Pilots’ Productivity Allowance**  
  
>  
>In addition to the basic salary, a pilot will receive the PPA (Pilots’ Productivity Allowance). The PPA is an hourly rate paid for every hour flown. Under the prevailing CA, the PPA comprises up to 30% of a pilot’s total income. As this part of the pilot’s salary is based on productivity, it is variable – the more a pilot flies, the more he earns. As such, in cases when flights are cancelled, if he is sent on course, or if he is on medical or annual leave, his salary will be correspondingly affected. Thus, a pilot’s salary can fluctuate – the less he flies, the lower his income.  
  
>  
>**Pilots Leave Entitlement**  
  
>  
>Captains and First Officers of SIA on national terms have 36 and 32 days of annual leave respectively, while expatriates enjoy 42 days annual leave. SilkAir national pilots enjoy between 30-36 days leave each year. The industry standard is on average 42 days per year. Pilots do not enjoy any off days on any of the statutory holidays.

If I recall correctly, their cash holding is about mid 1 billion, plus they have a bond maturing in July? About 2 quarters at best to burn all cash. But they have a reasonably large fleet of planes, so selling some might help, though the prices they will get now won't be the best price lah.

Anyway, government bailout is the last resort lah. Credit lines (which they are doing now), private placement of new shares among the institution-level investors and finally, rights issue are some ways to raise money.

These slogans are typically waved around with very little understanding of the specific details of the situation.

SQ is a private company, but more than 50% of its shares are own by Temasek, which in turn is owned by the Government. Needless to say, Temasek's money comes from the Government and we all know where the Government gets its money from. SQ's good performance means good returns for Temasek's investment, which then also means a larger sovereign wealth fund for Singapore. 

SQ is also an integral brand name to Singapore. It is part of the allure of Changi Airport, and one of the reasons we are an air travel hub. 

We all profit from SQ doing well.

I don't think ATCs would be so badly hit that they might lose job security. Staffing may be temporarily reduced a bit, so maybe fewer shifts per week/month, but airspace will always need to be controlled. I doubt CAAS would have to go through the laborious exercise of retrenching controllers only to have to try to rehire the same people again once we recover.

Pilots would definitely be losing jobs. 

Specialized jobs like ATCs have always been in demand not easy to replace. I assume they would be keeping ATCs.

Conversion of an aircraft from passenger to freighter literally takes months. It isn’t as simple as just removing the seats, putting in cargo and fly. If it were that simple, many airlines would have already done it. Stripping a cabin bare only takes 2-3 days.

2nd, SIA flies almost exclusively new models of aircraft, these new models were never intended to be configured as freighters this early in their lifetime. As such, the documentation of how to convert them to freighters hasn’t even been written yet.

=== Author: zeroX14===
SIA already has a cargo business. If there's no global demand for items to be sent out via SG, the planes will still be stuck.

=== Author: lizhien===
definitely. Now is the time to do long defered maintenance. But.. the airline must be willing to pay for the work to be done. If they can't project when they can resume flying, they might not want to do the work now.

=== Author: jencrs===
Wow, you really really have no idea what you are talking about.

The union exists and is regularly in negotiation with the company for things like Collective Agreements, Service Increments etc.

You can't just fire all pilots. As a company, would you spend $500k-$750k to train someone to be a co-pilot (not even a captain yet) only to fire them? Where another company would later reap those benefits? Then when air traffic picks up, where would you find pilots to fly your planes?

And the union does not simply accept whatever SIA offers them, as you put it. There are many ways to skin a cat, many ways to save the company money in times such as these. The union is there to represent the pilots' interests in these cuts.

Please please stop posting all these fake information which you obviously have no knowledge of. It hurts my head just reading, and you mislead others.

edit: phrasing

=== Author: altern8tif===

What's extreme about it? Singapore government is the majority owner of SIA, they can delist and nationalize it anytime they like. They can also put it back on SGX whenever they feel like it.

Not disagreeing with you, it does take awhile however we know there is likely to be cargo demand for quite some time. This also keeps your crews flying and at last resort the planes can be leased to other cargo carriers. We are going to see years of reduced capacity and the 330's can go right now https://www.elbeflugzeugwerke.com/en/freighter-conversion/a330-p2f/ *I know nothing about airline management!

=== Author: lizhien===
Not so simple. You need approval from the manufacturer and the authorities on passenger to freighter (PTF) conversions. The easiest solutions would be to park the jets. Even parking requires maintenance. You don't just shut the doors and walk away

=== Author: leo-g===
Given SIA’s fleet’s age, I don’t think they have much deferred maintenance. But taking advantage of this downtime to quickly transition SilkAir to SIA is probably a good idea. SIA group does their own their own engineering too, so the cost is just parts and labour without any markup.

=== Author: nova9001===
SIA could and will fire pilots who don't cooperate. In the early 2000's 55% of the pilots refuse to accept a pay reduction and attempted to hold a strike over it. LKY dealt with it by giving them a choice, either accept it or they can all leave. 

Here you are claiming its impossible to fire the pilots involved and how I am posting fake info.

LKY shut them down hard in the early 2000s. There was no negotiation. He made it clear that SIA was ready to let go of the 55% of pilots who were threatening to go on strike.

Situation now is even worst than during SARS. If the SIA pilots start shit now, SIA can just fire them all and cut costs. No other airline is hiring anyway.

=== Author: nova9001===
Pay cut better than no pay. The pilots have been well paid for years if you have no savings to prepare for a crisis, that's all on you. If it was a private company, they would just go bankrupt. SIA is majority owned by the Singapore government so most losses is going to be paid by taxpayers. 

There are many other low income industries affected and these people have no pay.

You’re right about cargo demand. That is why scoot continues to utilise their dreamliners for cargo exclusively. Flying with only 2 pilots on board and no other crew.

As for the A330s of SIA, conversion to freighter is not possible since those aircraft are leased from Airbus and not owned by SIA itself.

=== Author: Splynnnn===
Especially with our climate, any aircraft parked here for an extended time is gonna have a big corrosion problem.

sigh..... really? that's what you've got to back you up? An article from 16 years ago. So after all that talk from LKY, how many pilots were actually fired?

Let's see, 16 years. A guy could have joined the airline, gone through the interview, finished his cadet training, finished his 2nd officer training, did his time as a first officer, then more time as a senior first officer, finished his command training and then spent a few years as a commander.

What I'm saying is, the pilot body is largely different, the union is different, the voting is different, the management is different, the government is different, the aviation industry is different.

How can you take something from 16 years ago and say this is true now without anything else?

Btw is this article the only thing you know about that incident? It wasn't such a simple thing as refusing a pay reduction and attempting to go on strike, you know? There was so much more to it.

=== Author: BlankTOGATOGA===
ALPA-S is still alive and well. However the days of table-banging is long gone. Both sides come to the table to work things out in a civil manner. At this critical time, both sides will have to work out a way to ensure the survival of the airline.

Firing of staff is always the last thing a company will want to do. Hiring and training a pilot costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. When this blows over, a SIA-trained pilot will be highly sought after globally. And the hiring airline will thank SIA for the free training.

SIA is already offering VNPL to staff. There are steps to be followed. CNPL may be implemented. MVC cuts. Not straight to firing.

=== Author: milo_peng===
Their biggest concern now is job security.  Pay-cuts are usually the first step, followed by no pay leave. Agreed, they are in a better position than most people. 

The risks that SIA gets into trouble and needs a bailout is high. Other than the Covid19 issue, they are also fucked because of their fuel hedging.  No one expected oil prices to crater to 20 bucks a barrel and their forward hedges are well north of those numbers. 

It is the same for any major carriers. A fucking perfect storm.

Other than the seed money given to Temasek in the 70s, which could arguably be from tax. I don't think Temasek has ever derived its funding from tax.

""*There was no negotiation*."" **False** also. Negotiations continued after the show down. LKY didn't just sit down to issue a threat. He was also there to listen to the pilots' unhappiness, which he promised to investigate.

""*They will have to accept whatever SIA offers them*."" Again, **false**. The upcoming cost saving measures are a result of negotiations between SQ and union. It's not simply a 1 way street.

""*I just proved you wrong*"" hahaha are you really trying to squirm your way out of this? You proved nothing.

""*If the SIA pilots start shit now, SIA can just fire them all and cut costs*."" That's what you said. You're using a situation 16 years ago and expect it to be applied today with no further information to make it relevant.

But you do you, buddy. There's really nothing else for me to add here. Good luck.

Once again, when it comes to unions under the Registrar of Unions, there are steps to be followed. First, the union and the company will negotiate terms. If no middle ground can be found, it goes to MOM for arbitration. Lastly, it goes to the courts. No need for strikes. And ALPA-S never threatens industrial action.

MAS is a different story. It was a big cash cow being milked by everyone. Like by Tajuddin.

> SINGAPORE: From 9am on Mar 27, all travellers arriving in Singapore, will have to submit a health declaration online before proceeding with immigration clearance, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Monday (Mar 23).

> Travellers - residents and long-term pass holders included - will have to submit their declaration via the SG Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The health declaration will be made available before Mar 27, so that travellers who are due to arrive before that can complete it in advance of their arrival, said ICA.

> ""This new entry requirement is an additional precautionary measure to mitigate the risk of importation of COVID-19 into Singapore, and will be subject to further review based on the global COVID-19 situation,"" said ICA in the media release.

> 

> The authority added that this new online health declaration function was developed in consultation with the Ministry of Health and is fully integrated with ICA's immigration system.

> All residents and long-term pass holders who submit their health declaration will need to select Residents on the website, after which they will be directed to provide their health and recent travel information, as well as personal and contact details.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""All travellers can submit their health declaration up to three days prior to arrival in Singapore,"" said ICA.

> They must re-submit their health declaration if there are changes to their health condition or travel history before arriving in Singapore. ICA added that those who make false declarations will be liable for prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act. First-time offenders face a fine of up to S$10,000 and jail for six months. Repeat offenders face double those penalties.

> 

> Once the rules kick in, those who have not submitted their health declaration electronically before arriving in Singapore will be required to do so upon arrival at the checkpoint, which could delay their immigration clearance, ICA said.

They finally decided to do this. Good step to curb further spread.

=== Author: jacobsnemesis===
I don’t see a timeframe mentioned? 

At the end of the day, Singapore needs to do what it can to protect it’s citizens and there’s obviously a feeling that this border closure is necessary in that regard.

It is crazy to be living through this though. I never thought I would see the day where Singapore closed its borders to tourists.

=== Author: lawliet89===
The previously enforced SHN for short term visitors has pretty much killed tourism here. I am guessing this is done to stop medical tourists from coming in.

=== Author: 557088===
Tomorrow marks the 5th day since we had the 47 case spike. Can expect more of them to start showing symptoms from now on.

=== Author: otio2014===
This is good news, and absolutely the correct decision by the government. 

This is going to absolutely wreck the economy though (or what was left of it). As a trading and transit hub, cutting off all stvs is gg to most companies in the hospitality business. Imagine the entire ecosystem at Changi...it's like a mini city there that would be dead without tourists. And you can't just hibernate a business and restart when the situation is better. Most of them will go bankrupt permanently, and with it hundreds of thousands of jobs. And this same idea would apply on a global scale to most other countries and mega-cities like NY, Paris etc too. We're all in for some really bleak times, it's going to get darker than it currently is :/

Anyone knows how those who have returned from overseas and are now put on Stay Home Notice are expected to make the commute back home? Are they sent back in an ambulance or are they free to take their commute of choice (i.e. taxi, mrt, drive themselves back home?)? And if they're making their own way back, are they given a deadline e.g. 1 hour to reach home?

Maybe I'm missing something here - but is there not a transmission risk through any of these returnees who may be asymptomatic if they're not being sent back home in a controlled manner?

A good reminder of just why they waited as long as possible to do this.

By now, the cost of doing so isn't very significant anymore since most countries in the region have already done it.

>Only work pass holders providing essential services, such as in healthcare and transport, will be allowed by the Ministry of Manpower to enter or return to Singapore. This also includes their dependents, MOH added

What does this sentence imply exactly. Does this mean work-pass holders (e.g. S-pass, Employment Pass) outside healthcare/transport cannot return to Singapore if they ever decide to leave? Or are these guys considered long-term pass holders?

=== Author: SHANNY2712===

Glad to hear this measure. I have been waiting for this. Good call by the Gov! I have been feeling redundant about handing out 14-day SHN to every visitor. Now tourists and short-term vistors gg already. Please hold your holiday urges. We will welcome you back with wide arms when the Corona is over. Good news.

=== Author: fortracyhyde===
Very good news

=== Author: kingsley2===
Most of you don't need to care about this, but they're also barring long term pass holders and dependents if they don't work in essential fields like medicine. I haven't seen my wife in 3 months, and just as she's about to land on the 29th from India, I feel like it's being snatched away from me. I understand the rationale for the decision but I don't have to feel good about it, right? Anyways, applied for permission from MoM, fingers crossed or whatever.

=== Author: maolyx===
Finally. Seems like it will start on 23 Mar 23:59 according to gov whatsapp. Hopefully this will at least ensure that people stop coming here for medical tourism or coming here to get tested at all. Some businesses will definitely be affected but I guess it is better than us reaching other countries' state where a complete lockdown is required, affecting even more then. Stay safe, stay vigilant people.

> # COVID-19: Singapore closes borders to all tourists, short-term visitors

> SINGAPORE – In a further attempt to manage the heightened risk of importation of COVID-19 cases, all short-term visitors will be barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> This will take effect from 11.59pm on Monday (23 March).

> In a doorstop with media on Sunday, Minister of National Development and coronavirus multi-ministry taskforce co-chair Lawrence Wong explained that this is to conserve resources so that the government can focus on Singaporeans returning from overseas.

> Previously, except for a handful of countries, short-term visitors were allowed to enter Singapore, with the condition that they serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

> Calling the new measure significant, Wong said they are needed because resources are now being expended to serve and enforce SHNs on short-term visitors. If they fall ill, they will also need medical treatment.

> Despite border restrictions, some 533 short-term visitors had arrived on Saturday alone.

> Wong said, “We need to focus our resources on the large number of returning Singaporeans at this time.”

> Almost 80 per cent of new COVID-19 cases in Singapore over the past three days (from noon on 21 March) were imported, with most of them Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning home.

> In total, these imported cases had travel histories to 22 countries.

> Further to this, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also be tightening the entry requirements for work pass holders. It will allow the entry or return of work pass holders, including their dependants, who are providing essential services, such as those in healthcare and transport.

> “We allow only those who are critically needed to come back,” he said.

> Currently, all work pass holders and their dependents planning to enter Singapore from any country are already required to obtain MOM’s approval before beginning their journey.

> There is currently no end-date to these measures.

Anyone know what this means for ship crew changes in Singapore, and foreign crew entering the country? Are they to be included in this ban?

I have a question on this.

Let's say this policy is working. Virus will slowly vanish and in May singapore has 0 cases for a month. BUT, the rest of the world are still having this problem and still rapidly increasing (US, Italy, Indonesia).

Now, I'm wondering how long Singapore can lasts in closing the border? And if they decide to re-open the border, wouldn't virus starts kicking in again?

I like this policy and how strict the government is, but I'm curious if they have thought the reliability of this decision in the future.

Alternative might be to open border only for countries with 0 case. Again, not sure if it's gonna be effective (some countries might still be under reporting)

=== Author: nctxdy===

I fully agree with this latest attempt to limit the number of imported cases but this is going to make my personal situation really difficult. 

I am engaged to a Singapore citizen with pre marriage LTVP approval but currently working in Johor (malaysia visa pending) because I can’t get a job in Singapore despite being a degree qualified civil engineer with 8 years experience.... 

I rent a place in Woodlands with my fiancée and before the lockdown, traveled to Johor Monday, returning Friday. 

I arrived back on Tuesday before the lockdown and currently serving SHN. So once the lockdown is lifted and I can return to work, I can’t re-enter Singapore unless ICA grant me an exception. 

Times are tough guys. Any thoughts?

My relative was trying to fly from Penang to Singapore a few hours ago. Checked in, got boarding pass. But then an official ran up to him to tell him he is not allowed on the plane. He is a tourist (British citizen) so he will enter Singapore as a short term visitor. The official read to him the restriction terms on how all short term visitors are restricted into Singapore, however failed to mention that this is only effective from Tuesday.  
   
He wasn’t the only one not allowed on the plane. How is this possible? Is there something he knew that we don’t? There was also no gate number for his flight even though the current status of the flight is “scheduled”. Same for most other flights. Not even “en-route” or “landed” for the earlier flights. Does anyone know what is going on?

They are aiming the medical tourists IE rich Malaysians/Indonesian/Thais etc

For these people, they might be able to fly private and they can probably afford staying in Singapore for 14 days to get medical treatment

=== Author: N4ilbyt3r===
It's pretty obvious the measures came in a little late. Had this been done earlier, it would have bought some or enough time, easier for our healthcare to manage the number of cases and would have cut the spread by a certain amount at least. 

People who went ahead with non-essential travel at this time aren't responsible people in the first place. Having them here can never be good.

Happy for that decision nevertheless. It does make me feel our lives just started to matter a bit more now.

Singapore airlines is saying on their website that noone is even allowed to transit through Singapore can anyone confirm this?

=== Author: bitflag===
With the 14 days SHN for all arrivals already in place, this makes little difference. Very very few tourists are gonna show up if they are gonna be stuck 2 weeks in a hotel room first.

Bigger difference might be on transit for the occasional chance of contamination in the transit section but I figure Changi is a ghost town by now.

=== Author: silentstar_===
I guess the situation is serious enough to warrant not having a deadline, seeing nobody could estimate when the situation (worldwide) will improve. 

If they say the deadline is two weeks, there is still the possibility of extending that deadline for (for example) another two weeks, and even then who knows how many extensions there will be.

Dude I feel you, I know many sentiments are towards “finally the G did something” and “omg it’s about time”, but we gotta realize how serious this shit is if Singapore, a country that relies extremely heavily on foreign entities, tourism and international services, decides to take such an extreme measure.

I’m sure they’ve tried their best to keep borders open (because our economy depends on it) as long as possible but alas, it’s too much. On top of that, with every other country implementing similar measures, I guess they’d be more inclined to make the decision too.

This is gonna kill half of SIA's main business at the moment though - that being Chinese/Australian nationals fleeing Europe for China/Australia. Was on a flight back just a few days ago and the amount of Chinese nationals was staggering.

I do get the ban on short term visitors entering Singapore but I'm not sure why they banned transit though.

=== Author: Sputniki===
The SHN already killed medical tourists though? No medical tourist who thinks they have Covid will fly here if it means delaying treatment for two freaking weeks. That could easily mean death. A ton of other options available to these wealthy medical tourists would be far superior at this point.

=== Author: Taellion===
This more of a controlled wreck, then letting the virus uncontrollably wreck and forced a shutdown.

Look at New York City and Paris, the virus is actively spreading and they have to shut down all non-essential businesses in order to tame it. 

For us, yes, our tourism sector will take a big hit (but is not like we have much tourists coming in right now, pandemic and all), but we can continue to carry as close to normal as much as possible and not a total shutdown. Which I argue is easier to start running again than to starting from a total shutdown.

=== Author: adognow===
It's not just Singapore shut down, it's the entire world. Whether we close the border or not matters very little from an economic standpoint, but it will make the world of difference from a medical one. The benefits far outweigh the risks from a national, holistic standpoint. 

Not to forget, we're one of the last major countries to shut the border.

It appears that there are clear thresholds that warrants proportionate responses in the drawer plan. 

This also shows that despite the focus on economy and growth and GDP, our government takes necessary actions that will heavily impact the economy to curb the spread. This is despite the local transmission (non imported) numbers are still considered low.

=== Author: canceler80===
Hehe. Your second paragraph doesnt sound like good news at all.

=== Author: stikskele===
The SHN is essentially a precaution. The risk is slightly higher than locals who have not had direct contact with a confirmed case, but also not significant enough to warrant quarantine. There are literally thousands of people returning from abroad right now, including all those studying abroad and on exchange - it’ll be a logistical nightmare to have to arrange transportation for all of them. 

Also I believe the SHN only starts from the day *after* they land? Had a Facebook acquaintance returning from Europe post pics of Jewel and their lunch there before they went home.

=== Author: dirkp78===
I am curious to know as well as I’ll be back in sg on 26th. Wondering if I’ll be allowed to take the train or must grab? And also, how will I receive the SHN? From the customs officer?

Well, I’m coming back tomorrow to Singapore from Japan, so you might be the one handing out 14 day SHN to me. Also I’m Singaporean, so I got no other country that I can go back to.

I got a question though, I got no official residence and I booked a place in a hostel like one month back (along with my plane ticket). 

Does that count as my place of residence now or do I go to the quarantine hostel?

I got no real objection to going to a quarantine hostel as long as it has wifi and I can study.

Mostly means those crews aren't going to be allowed off their ships. Crew changes might qualify, based on the ""essential services"" exception, but practically speaking the thing to do is simply limit contact between the ship crews and shore. Which honestly means little more than denying sailors shore leave time. I mean, of all the groups of people who can maintain social distance, ship crews are about the easiest to keep safe.. pay 'em a bonus, keep them from getting sick.

(That said, some ships have been at sea since early February. So at this point may depend on circumstances).

The government will try to balance between the economy and the infection risk. The policies will change accordingly. I don't think the government is targeting 0 infections. They are trying to make sure our healthcare has enough capacity at any time.

Anyway, considering the nature of the Covid-19, it is either half of the population infected within the next few months, or the containment is working. In any case we should see the end of this pandemics by June / July.

=== Author: mukansamonkey===
Odds are good that this level of restriction is going to last until the current round of Singaporeans returning from overseas mostly stops happening. And in the meantime most existing cases get well (doesn't have to be zero sick, just really few). At that point what I'd expect is that we return to the previous state, the mandatory 2-week stay at home order for visitors.

Honestly though, the 2-week order on all people coming into the country is likely to exist for the next year, minimum. Until there's a vaccine. Before then there's simply no way that this thing is going to ""go away"" in the rest of the world. Because keeping the infection rate low enough in most countries that their healthcare doesn't totally break down, means keeping it low enough that total immunity rates won't be very high a year from now. If even 1% of a modern country's population has it at any given moment, that will be enough to utterly overwhelm the healthcare systems and then the death rate skyrockets.

We really have to hope that this thing is still spreading a year from now. The alternative is millions of unnecessary deaths.

It depends on whether you are either a SG citizen or PR or long term pass holder. If you belong to one of them, you would not be affected by this measure. There might be different measures in future, so try to return asap if you can. 

If you are a citizen but can’t find flights back, do contact Ministry of foreign affairs or SG embassy. They have been helping several Singaporeans to find ways to come back.

=== Author: dyingumbrella===
Probably not!

If you are an SG citizen, PR, or work pass holder in specific fields, you have to do the two-week stay at home routine when you return. If you're anyone else, you're probably out of luck.

The ASEAN pre-authorization last week was basically for Indonesians, but the SG government couldn't pointedly ban Indonesians alone because their government has a perennial case of small-penis syndrome.

Treatment isn't delayed. I believe if you show symptoms during your 14 days SHN there is a number to call where you can get medical attention. 

The 14 days SHN isn't a problem as well if they test positive at the airport too right? They just go straight to hospital?

=== Author: EstonianBlue===
It's easier to circumvent than one thinks though. SHN's meant to stop the spread in the community, but if you have symptoms and all, you just gotta call the PA number and get yourself assistance for a check-up with the GP.

They could always claim they are asymptomatic until their arrival in Singapore, and some may very well be, and get tested positive and get shipped to NCID/wherever.

=== Author: lawliet89===
I think they could still come and book a hotel to do SHN and then go to the hospital if they worsen. Or straightaway send themselves to the hospital.

Yeah certainly this is the best response. If the situation is not controlled and get to like Lombardy, it's infinitely worse. 

But I feel many are under estimating how much life is going to change in the future. I'd say your sentiment of a ""passing period of difficulty after which things get back to normal"" is our optimism bias heavily at play. As the Imperial college study modelled, as soon as you lift the social distancing measures, the cases shoot back up. A vaccine is at least 18 months away, best case scenario. No company can survive for 18 months. They will go bankrupt within 6, and that's assuming the government can bail them out for even 6 months. We are very likely going to see widespread unemployment (perhaps 20-40% of the population) in ways the global conscience has not seen since the great depression.

I suppose the impact of this measure will be marginal, given that air travel is grinding to a halt globally, and short term visitors need to stay in for 14-days. But in the short term, will still free up capacity in a stressed monitoring/healthcare system with so many infected returning nationals.

Once the hostel finds out that you’re there to self-isolate, most likely they will either refund and ask you to leave or something along the lines of that. If the room that you booked is a private one and has everything you need i.e. bathroom, fridge, sure, you probably don’t have to leave or be in contact with people so much. However hostels usually have a shared kitchen and bathrooms or if you’re staying in a dormitory, so it defeats the purpose.

The issue seems to be even if you give SHN it takes resources to track that, which right now can be utilised for other things.

I believe they are quite strict on it.

Yeah but Qantas was forced by the fact ScoMo banned non-Australian citizens and PR from going in; they were still intending to run QF1/2 on SYD-PER-LHR (rather than via Singapore) in April before that made it untenable.

Yeah but those are predicated on a bunch of hypotheticals - maybe they have flu or pneumonia but not Covid. Or maybe they aren’t picked up at hospital and have to stay at the hospital. And they can’t visit their personal doctors at private clinics because they can’t walk into the building - they’ll be screened at the entrance as well as the clinic reception. If they misdeclare or lie, they’ll be arrested. Why would anyone take such a risk compared to flying to other first world countries with similarly great facilities and doctors? It just makes zero sense.

=== Author: Sputniki===
Why even go to that hassle? There are a ton of countries with superior healthcare to Indonesia which have not implemented the 14 day SHN. A lot of these tourists also come to visit their personal doctors at fancy private clinics. They’re not interested in being sent to A&E at any neighborhood hospital.

yes and no. they can finish their shopping + eating at changi/jewel that day and return home immediately to start the SHN.

The border with Malaysia is a massive exception to this new policy. Due to the enormous numbers of Malaysians who work in SG, the standard entry policy isn't going to be the same for them. Currently the two governments are in the process of working out what the rules will be for the Causeways, but it's still very much a work in progress.

Chances are good that, as a LTVP holder with a job in Johor, you'll end up covered under the carve-out for the Malaysians. The trouble is though, that carve out may very well prohibit daily commutes back and forth. So IMO you really ought to stay in SG until that policy gets sorted, and then figure out from there.

Quoting from the statement -

“
4.        From 23 March 2020, 2359 hours, all short-term visitors (from anywhere in the world) will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore. Furthermore the Ministry of Manpower will only allow the entry/ return of work pass holders [2], including their dependents, for those providing essential services, such as in healthcare and transport.  

5.         As previously announced, all Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders [3] returning to Singapore will be issued a 14-day SHN. [4] Persons under SHN must remain in their place of residence at all times “

If your long term employment pass is not in the “essential services”, you might not be allowed entry after 2359 today.

On a personal basis, I’ll advise you to try to contact 

1. MOM (ministry of manpower) / employer - 
as you would be coming back to Sg for work. 

2. MFA (ministry of foreign affairs) - they might have flights arranged to bring back Singaporeans and offer you assistance to get back to Singapore

3. Your citizenship’s foreign ministry - from the recent news articles, almost all countries offer assistance to their concerns who are overseas.

Good luck and stay healthy!

1. All ASEAN nationals coming into Singapore need to fill up the health declaration, regardless coming from each country; and prior to that, that was enforced on all private jet occupants - a day after the Indonesian private jet case came in.

It's hard to say if either China or Korea are ""winning"". China did one of the most draconian shutdowns in modern history (the shutdowns in NY, Italy, Spain etc are nowhere as stringent). They did this for almost 2 months straight, and haven't still opened up. The real question is if or when they open up, and business resumes to at least 80% of prior levels, after two-four weeks, would there be massive clusters popping up again? Unless we're very sure the answer to this is no, it's far far from winning. Cos repeated shutdowns is exactly what the study modelled. 

Korea did better cos they reacted so far and tested very very widely. But their daily life is still absolutely not back to anywhere near normal. And even with this shutdown they still had almost 100 cases yesterday. The question is, if or when the Korean towns open up and try to resume ""business as usual"", will we see cases shooting up again? Cos if so, again that just validates the Imperial study. It's simply too early to say China or Korea are ""winning""

Lol, those 2 sentences are not your original comment.

You said:

*>  They are aiming the medical tourists IE rich Malaysians/Indonesian/Thais etc*

*> For these people, they might be able to fly private and they can probably afford staying in Singapore for 14 days to get medical treatment*

You used present and future tenses in your second sentence.  In your follow-up comment, you then called him dense while saying that the time period you were referring to was ""prior to the closure of borders"".

However, if you meant to refer to this time period (which is in the past), you should not have used those tenses in your second sentence.

Your second sentence in your original comment should have been phrased along the lines of:

""These people were able to fly private and they could probably have afforded to stay in Singapore for 14 days to get medical treatment.""

He can't be faulted for thinking you were referring to the present when your sentence was using present and future tenses.  Border controls now exist in the present.  Your sentence did not make sense.  If you wish to be understood, communicate properly.  Don't blame the reader if you are not expressing what you mean to express.

Official statement: https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/additional-border-control-measures-to-reduce-further-importation-of-covid-19-cases

Transits are included in the ban and starts on 2359 23 Mar 2020. If you transit and leave Sg before that time, you should be unaffected. 

I am guessing you would be able to get that onward boarding pass if the transit is before the ban and won’t get it if the transit is after. This should be catering to travellers who are already transiting at Changi Airport when the statement is made.

You should also check with your airlines and travel insurance agency (if any).

Good luck !

Again  I'm asking here cause I got conflicting information from ICA...

=== Author: daysof_I===
True, but I don't know how to translate what we call them here in English other than ""locals"" that doesn't sound offensive. Chinese Indonesian calls them either 印尼人 or Huana (foreigner), and Huana is considered an insult, a deragotary term for Indonesian Indonesian here. I mean that Hokkien word has bad conotation anyway, often used to call foreigners who are barbarian. 

While Chinese Indonesian here refers other Chinese Indonesian as either 印尼华人 or 中国人, or Tenglang. Mix-race people (whose parents are chindo and indo-indo) we call em Ampyang, taken from Indonesia's traditional snack with the same name. The snack is made of groundnut (symbol for chinese cause lighter color = light skin color) and brown sugar (symbol for local cause got darker color = dark skin color), although again only Chindo use this word cause it's also considered offensive for the locals (our ancestors are quite asshole-y when I think about it now). So for example if I we say ""eh eh she got new boyfriend alr, you know or not?"" then usually some will then ask ""really? tenglang or huana? Or ampyang?"" cause deep down we're all racist like that, not even gonna try to say we don't. We do. We all do at some point.

Judging by how many people are out tonight, either nobody cares, or they don't know this.

=== Author: ChinaWine_official===
Epidemiologically-speaking, the measure you want is not “per capita” but “per population-at-risk”. It’s unreasonable to use the whole of China’s population as a denominator because not everyone in China is at risk. China is huge as hell, so is the US, and not every person is at risk or at the same level of risk. You can’t lump rural America and city America together, they have totally different levels of risk. The measure can be used for Singapore but for larger countries it’s totally incorrect. 

A better measure would be “per capita” but constrain the comparison to cities instead of countries.

=== Author: sarah-lee1991===
I'm going to get a lot of ire but this (percentage of confirmed cases per capita) is not the statistics that actually matters. We're talking lives here. Percentage of confirmed cases should be used to communicate the severity of the spread. Deaths too as that is an indication of how well the healthcare system is coping with the virus.

Also looking at the lines and how they progress, it shows there is kind of a plateau for Singapore. There is a spike now because of the imported cases from other countries. 

I'm not saying we can be complacent and return to life from before. We have to do our part. We still have to be cautious and wary. Do our part to minimise contact and remain at home when sick. 

We've seen clear examples of when people think only of themselves without thinking of others.

But there have been very few recent cases of local transmission.   If you believe the reports the issue is mainly imported cases.  No one is catching it on a bus or at a food court.   The good thing is sick people are staying home and positive cases are in hospital and their contacts at home.

=== Author: vitaliksellsneo===
This is absolutely natural as Singapore has some factors which skew this metric, notably:

1. Low population : Each plane that comes in suddenly bear a lot of weight. Imagine if same plane goes to San Marino
2. High Traffic : We are a hub and many people travel through here

That said, I think our govt is doing pretty well for several reasons. The deaths we've had so far are those with pre existing conditions - heck, one was a guy who pretty much came here for medical treatment. For those who imported the virus back, aggressive contact tracing helped minimise spread and contained it very fast. For a dense population our rate of spreading with cases is considered low I think. Many measures in place really try to nip the spread in the bud. 

Just to clarify, I'm not working for the government.  My 2c. I'm not saying the government can't do better, but I think they are doing well given above factors. Also, we all have a part to play in this

Cool graph! I hope to see it updated. Actually I find it reassuring because our slope is relatively shallow on this log scale. If trends continue, Canada and Australia have fewer cases per capita now, but they will exceed us soon.

Japan and Iran have flatter curves but I don't trust their stats at all.

Local transmission cases are up. Don't underestimate this virus. It can suddenly hit hard. Slowing down spread is a good thing (potential threatments might arise, hospitals are not overrun) but as Europe, US and Korea experienced or are experiencing  things can get out of control soon. 

I see people coughing all over the MRT and food courts, I expect stricter measures soon. Singapore is quite rightly so commended on their actions, but unfortunately Singaporeans are now believing that everything will go away with little or no consequences. There is no threatment, this disease will go around and around until herd immunity takes over.

We have 5.5 million people in Singapore. 

1% is 55,000

0.01% is 550.

At the rate of daily increase we'll hit that sometime tomorrow or day after. Very easily done, we're at 438

=== Author: RazeXIX===
I agree news media is bogus , but if u look at the rate of spread and deaths over time , this is far worse than any of the diseases u mentioned.  It is kinda dumb to say that the people working around rn are smart in any manner. Western countries r worried for good reason . If anything the massive increase of infection should simply make us more wary and cautious... we don’t wanna suddenly be in a situation like them ( not saying we are or will be... sg govt op but these peeps walking around is bad bad)

Because Singapore has extensive testing, contact tracing and as a result, almost zero undetected/unknown sources of community spread. 

Canada may have better numbers, but how many undetected cases do they have?

And honestly, if there's no undetected community spread, then it's not out in the community. At that point, why even be scared?

Singapore is testing nowhere as aggressively as Korea. They've got drive through test stations there. Whether that is needed, or effective is another topic for discussion.

I’d thought Singapore will follow HK in the wide adoption of masks. Seems to have taken the same attitude as Australians here, that masks are only useful if one is unwell.

=== Author: screwedforgp===
Not that. It is suspicious because the new cases are.... Unbelievable

=== Author: FinnSolomon===
Local transmission cases are up slightly, but the majority of them are linked. The number of local unlinked cases, in other words, someone catching the virus and having no idea how it happened, remains very low. Going by the daily updates, it's about less than five a day.

=== Author: evilplushie===
5.7 according to latest.  Even at 0.01% it means one out of 10,000 unique people you meet, one will have the disease

=== Author: redditor_here===
Not being sarcastic or being a dick, but you mind sharing a source that shows that covid19 is more infectious than H1N1? I know the rate of infections is higher due to way more global traffic these days, but is it actually more infectious? Genuinely curious.

Agreed. I suspect that I actually got it, but recovered. Went to GP hoping that I would be referred for testing but the GP didn't seem concerned based on my symptoms.

=== Author: XPMai===
No, it's a matter of distribution of masks. Unlike Taiwan, South Korea or Vietnam, Singapore isn't a manufacturer of masks. It therefore has to prioritise the limited number of masks to those who need it the most: frontline medical staff and people who are sick.

If you refer to Hong Kong, they have a severe shortage of masks for frontline medical workers.

Since Singapore isn't a manufacturer and all masks are imported, by buying those masks for ourselves when we need it less compared to others, we're depriving other frontline medical staff in other countries from having that supply instead.

=== Author: Achro===
Singapore doesn't have a mask-wearing culture like South Korea, Hong Kong & co.

*Even if* a healthy supply of masks existed.

=== Author: samglit===
That’s not true - anyone who is actively infected is isolated. So you need to calculate the probability of meeting an undetected case.  Which should be much lower since everyone coming home is being isolated for 14 days.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
R0 value for h1n1 was 1.2-2.4. They estimate that the r0 for coved 19 is 2.5+. R0 is , on average , how many others an infected spreads the disease.

=== Author: Point0ne===
Er, no!

=== Author: Kazozo===
We don't need pretentious bs at a time like this.

=== Author: Gungalley===
Please don't blame the GP. They're incredibly stressed during this period. And there are only a few places that can test for covid right now. Most GPs in Singapore cannot do that. And for the places that do, there are guidelines in place for who to swab.

=== Author: AnnoymousXP===
You think Vietnam has mask wearing culture too?

=== Author: evilplushie===
So even lesser than 500

=== Author: magneticanisotropy===
I'd also note, outside of the lower R0, H1N1 ended up having a fatality rate of about 0.02%, which is lower than  even the normal seasonal flu.  H1N1 isn't even comparable to the current coronavirus in terms of R0 or deadliness...

=== Author: Point0ne===

=== Author: AnnoymousXP===
Alright, that's true. But Vietnam didn't have the culture of wearing helmet for motorcycles, only until recently they changed the way of living and started wearing them.

When there is a need for mask, regardless of whether we accustomed to it, we gotta wear it.

If we want to talk about culture, I can stretch Vietnamese context a little bit that it's never a Vietnamese culture to wear surgical mask. Vietnam is poor why buy surgical mask when you can have reusable mask? But because of the crisis, everyone adapts.

For Singapore context, the inertia for mask isn't because of *culture*, but because of how inaccessible masks are. I wouldn't say it's out of stock, but it's very hard to find a shop that has the stock. If it's ubiquitous, I think Singapore govt would've mandated wearing of masks too.

I have always wanted to know. Are these imported cases checked at the airport itself the moment they arrive and whisked away to the hospital if they are confirmed to be infected or after a few days since their arrival?

=== Author: HereForSomeContent===
Who's currently the longest infected patient?

=== Author: jurafalle===
Yes! There are not many non-imported cases, in which most of them are linked. I guess we are receiving lesser people returning back to SG after the implementation of strict SHN and closing our borders to short term visitors thus the lower number today. 

Things are looking good! Let's hope tomorrow will be better!

=== Author: ThatAndresV===
Or just fewer flights on Sundays? SG is doing incredibly well but we’ve a tough couple of weeks ahead as more folks come home -while we all keep our fingers crossed that everyone sticks to SHN and anyone else outside acts responsibly.

Encouraging though :)

=== Author: sgtransitevolution===
I think the main problem is that this virus spread is exponential (Ahem A Math real-life application questions). So to have any untraced cases would be worrying, and we have 31. This peace is quite fragile, so it’s best to still be mentally prepared that worse things are still to come.

=== Author: redwithin===
The numbers that you're seeing are already Singaporeans who have left exchange programmes, studies overseas and more. I'd expect the daily numbers to continue to be high for the next two weeks, with an increased number of local cases towards the end, before stabilising after that.

=== Author: redwithin===
Case 35, the 64 year old taxi driver. Case 41 (71 year old) and Case 42 (Bangladeshi migrant worker) are also around that period.

Likely all 3 have been in ICU and honestly, 6 weeks in ICU is really bad news.

=== Author: KeythKatz===
That's not how it works. You'd have to wait at least a week to see how measures have done. These cases are from the first wave of returning Singaporeans when shit started getting real in Europe. There should be another spike in imported cases as returning USA Singaporeans develop symptoms.

=== Author: ju5t_wonder1ng===
IMO You are confusing the notion of testing capacity from a hospital operations POV. All blood tests have their respective priority stated, and most likely any patient testing for Covid 19 will get STAT status.

Testing capacity for normal tests yes. E.g. for outpatient clinics.

Testing capacity for emergency and majority of inpatient related blood tests, no, they are 100% 24/7.

Used to work in TTSH and directly with the peeps in lab.
We are dealing with a crisis of sorts here, so...no, I am sure they have setup their shifts to deal with increased requests.

=== Author: gretsall===
Yes, I believe the family of people serving SHN are still carrying on about their daily lives. I have a cousin that just flew back from exchange in UK. It is up to each individual household to do their part and minimize contact.

you're the one who needs help. Its only ever linear if R0 is exactly 1. More than or less than 1, its an exponential that slopes up or down.

You can go look at the past press releases. Most of the reports on sunday are consistent with the weeks average usually.

=== Author: EarthwormJane===
Based on fact. They are fully staffed with full shifts (and staff on call) on the weekends. They are no longer allowed to take AL unless there is an emergency.

Source: Fiance and cousin are working in the same hospital lab.

=== Author: George_W_Bushido===
5 day mc better to get on a weekday

=== Author: ryuuheii===
Based on the logic that they probably were not staffed for 7 day work weeks. 

Also the observation has been that there tends to be less cases on the weekends, particularly Sundays. It could be other factors too though, like less cases getting reported for testing.

=== Author: ryuuheii===
I'm sure that the shifts are adjusted to work on weekends. There just might be less people pulling weekend duty, especially if they weren't staffed for it before.

=== Author: ju5t_wonder1ng===
Yes from a statistic POV ppl tend to report sick on mondays, tuesdays and fridays, and avoid the weekends.

But that is for majority of diseases / illnesses and hence this is why polyclinics run 5.5 days and PHPCs assist further to handle this load. 

I am sorry but this virus doesnt wait for anyone, hence your point while valid, is weak and negligible in the light of current circumstance.

=== Author: EarthwormJane===
Wrong. The hospital lab section testing for COVID are scheduled to be fully staffed with full shifts every day. There are also those who are on call in case of short staff.

Source: Fiance is one of them and my cousin is in the core lab of the same hospital.

=== Author: soonnanandnaanssoon===
Please extend my gratitude to your fiance and cousin for working in the labs diligently in these times. 

Being in the lab for extended periods of time can be crazy mentally exhausting, and yet their work is essential and important to maintain the efforts at containing this pandemic. Thank you and hope they get the support and test they need to push them through this period.

=== Author: ryuuheii===
I stand corrected then

=== Author: EarthwormJane===
Yes I agree. I'm also a med tech actually, and I used to work the same gruelling hours in another big lab. The fluorescent lights were a killer. Also, going into work with sun but coming out at night is really miserable. I'm now working in a lab that is attached to a clinic so its smaller, but the type of work I do is just as draining, but still not as bad as them.

I know how they feel and it really sucks. The only way they can cheer themselves up is by jokingly calling this period a ""goldmine"" because of the extra shifts. Thank you for your gratitude! 

Being in healthcare really sucks right now but tbh, we all knew what we signed up for. There was always a chance that something like this would happen, but we never expected it to be now. I'm sure the both of them (and me) appreciate your thanks. But just know that to us, its all just part of the job! Someone's gotta do it, might as well be us.

Counterintuitive to see the construction sector being hit the hardest during the period. I only now realised how sensitive it was to supply chain and man-power disruptions.

Bear in mind that although the figure is for Q1, the true decline only started probably around mid-Feb when the world started to realize how real the situation was. Hence, -2.2% probably had some cushioning from the first half of Q1. You want to see the true impact, wait for Q2.

Grey does not mean social distancing. It means lower activity, maybe due to lock down or stay at home for feat of virus. If you look from that point of view, you right Singapore still go on daily activities. Other countries are having lock down or cautioned to stay at home. SG stand is business as usual, stay home if unwell/sick. Although mass gathering has been banned.

Found a figure quoted in an FT article published yesterday:

>As of March 20, Singapore had conducted **38,000 tests, or about 6,800 examinations per million population**, the health ministry said. That rate outpaced South Korea, the region’s poster child for fast and expansive testing, which had administered about 6,100 tests per million population in the same time frame.

such info are too “insider” to know. 

anyway, covid test kits are a much needed “rare” resource. there are other test for symptoms such as pneumonia that also serves towards covid test in the grand scheme of things.

We're above South Korea? Amazing.

On 27th feb ABC News reported SK was at 10k per day, after a peak of 13k during the Shincheonji outbreak on the 24th. Wired links a WSJ article dated 16th mar for a figure of 20k per day. 

For Singapore, on the 10th Today reported, ""We are prepared to scale them up — we have the capacity to do as much as 2,000 tests in a day,” Assoc Prof Mak said. Each test costs around S$260, he had said before.

SK has a population slightly above 9x of SG. 

We also pledged to donate 3k test kits to Myanmar on the 4th and 3k to the Philippines yesterday. 

It seems that we are not testing to our full capacity yet, as our capability to test should have increased since the 10th. We are not testing the population like SK. Contact tracing is still working for us.

Uh in ""the time frame"", which I'm assuming to be last week.

South Korea did 10,000 to 15,000 tests a week at the peak of it's outbreak (that church in the 2 cities).

The “timeframe” refers to the cutoff date of March 20. It’s not talking about within the past week only.

Unpopular opinion ? Huh ? This is literally all I hear - both on reddit and in my day to day conversations.

=== Author: ngrenjie===
It doesn’t make their points invalid though. 

I realise that while PAP isn’t perfect, they aren’t run by idiots either. I will say that the government has generally done a good job of managing the crisis and allowing us to still go about our daily lives without going into obvious panic mode, but I do feel that they have made numerous missteps which should not be beyond criticism. 

Just take the latest move by MOE. The government first allowed people to travel overseas during the March holidays, then retroactively slapped everyone who did just that with a mandatory 2-week LOA notice if they were working in a school. I mean, we teachers saw this problem coming a mile away prior to the March holidays (thousands of people with unknown travel histories flooding schools on the first day of the new term). 

The irony of this is that Malaysians who rushed into Singapore to avoid the lockdown found themselves subjected to this 2-week LOA if they were working in the education sector. This has left some schools without proper IT support because their tech support team comprise mainly of Malaysians. 

I also acknowledge that it’s sometimes unfair to be so quick to criticise decisions made in the fog and uncertainty of war, but this feels like a textbook case of various ministries each doing what makes sense for them, without anyone at the top coordinating everything. Everything I have seen so far has been mitigation and largely reacting to issues as they arise. Nobody wants to be the one to take a pro-active stand because they don’t want to be the one to take the blame if the envisioned scenario never materialised. 

We may have the resources to just spend our way out this crisis, but it feels like we are squandering our potential here. 

The opposition may not be fit to run the country, but that does not make the current government beyond reproach. Just because your room is less messy than everyone else’s doesn’t mean it’s not messy.

If you truly believe that we should leave political agendas aside, then the government should not be holding a GE until end of the year or even next year.

=== Author: Echokaph===
the PAP policies are not exactly radical or hugely different to other countries in their response to covid. the success of containing the coronavirus can be largely attributed to the healthcare system and the contract tracing done by the government agencies rather than the PAP itself. Considering other political parties would have likely taken a similar approach to coronavirus I don’t see why the PAP is the only one could’ve done this.

Then you proceed to say we shouldn’t involve political agenda in your post even though you post says all opposition parties are just talk?

Most Singaporeans are unable to separate the concept of the government from PAP. They will proceed to tell me “the government is majority PAP!” Or “don’t tell me you actually believe that the two are separate!” Or even worse, “don’t you know that the ministries are all working for PAP and everyone working in the ministry is a pap lapdog?!?!?!”

It’s sad, it’s untrue, but it’s a rampant belief. And I’m pretty sure that I’m going to get downvotes by the opposition sluts\* who firmly believe that the PAP _IS_ the government. 

\*opposition slut is someone who will support _any_ opposition voice regardless of who it is, however credible the person is, as long it is against the incumbent. As long as it’s non-PAP, they will be there.

=== Author: hopeinson===
Given that I has had friends working in some form or another in a ministry/agency in Singapore, as well as friends in Malaysia that are also working in some form or capacity in state/federal agencies, I suspect that people in general forget that the legislative arm of the government is *separate* from the executive arm of the government.

Yes it does. He is saying the move by Malaysia is religiously motivated (it's a good political bargaining chip used by the Malaysian gov to show Malaysians that the government helps fellow Muslims), and not a pure ""bro"" move. Some say that's cynical but knowing Malaysia and how much they use Islam for their political purposes, I'd say it's super probable.

We (SG/MY/others) can only help those who want to help themselves though.

Both SG/MY took drastic measures to protect its citizen - now look at the shitshow that's happening in Indonesia.

=== Author: fatenumber===
We are unsure if the eight evacuated Singaporeans are all Muslims. We also have to remember that Iran is a Shia Islamic country while Malaysia is more towards Sunni Islam. If the Singaporeans are indeed Muslims, then they are probably Shias and you surely would know the ""rivalry"" between Shia and Sunni. Taking this into consideration, it is more a pure ""bro"" move than otherwise.

In an ideal world, the people shouldn't suffer due to their government. Regardless of their poor (or absence of) initial response, if their government ask for help later, and if we can afford to help them then good loh.

=== Author: samglit===
Shitshow might be the best thing for Indonesia.

Just get it over with, lots of retirees die, they have herd immunity, and suddenly world is beating path to them for tourism and labour.

Basically whichever developing country gets out of this first with herd immunity will win big.  Pretending/being incompetent while still staying electable would be the biggest brain move available.

=== Author: jaryl===
Even if Malaysia found a vaccine for the virus, and cured cancer while they were at it, people will still find a way to complain.

=== Author: Neptunera===
I mean, questionable moral stance aside, that's assuming they're in a closed system.

We have a lot to lose with that shitshow going on simply because of our proximity. 

Even if Indonesians don't come here, there's bound to be unkers going over to Batam for entertainment who might then come back and spread it.

Waiting for the disease to completely die off while we twiddle thumbs just isn't a sound plan right now.

=== Author: samglit===
It’s a great move for Indonesia.  If they have herd immunity, transmission even from short term visitors will not be a major issue except for tourist hubs like Bali.  As long as 70% or 80% of a population is immune, transmission drops dramatically, so people will feel safe travelling there.

=== Author: ballsie995===
bro. thats not how herd immunity works, nor do we have vaccine now. also not sure if you are talking about natural immunity.

=== Author: potatetoe_tractor===
There's insufficient data about reinfectivity and short-term immunity post-infection, let alone long-term immunity from the virus. Herd immunity at this point is a flawed and potentially dangerous concept, which is why no one is implementing it unless they don't give a damn about the health and safety of their citizens (even the UK has abandoned the idea after experts weighed in on the matter).

=== Author: samglit===
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615375/what-is-herd-immunity-and-can-it-stop-the-coronavirus/

Herd immunity means many people are either naturally immune, immune because they already recovered or immune because they are vaccinated, such that there are so many immune people in a population it becomes impossible for a disease to spread widely.

=== Author: samglit===
I suspect it’s likely that this coronavirus (or more accurately human immune systems) will behave similarly to other coronaviruses in that the immunity will last a while even if temporary, especially if repeated exposures happen.

If Indonesians get sick, recover and are repeatedly exposed they probably won’t get sick again this year.

If it did not, every incidence of the disease would be permanent because the immune system won’t be able to clear it.  This is obviously not the case, especially since there are recovered cases not treated with antivirals.

Now it could be the virus somehow self destructs in the host after a while, but that seems unlikely given that recovered patients plasma treatment is effective.

You don’t need 100% data to make a prediction, and Indonesia is already playing fast and loose.

=== Author: ballsie995===
i guess including recovered people as herd immunity is technically correct, just not main idea since thats the aftermath byproduct of the epidemic, instead of a defensive measure. 

saw your discussion with another user, and would like to point out different factors that could majorly affect herd immunity. putting aside morality about death. 

1) time. herd immunity does not mean everyone gets the sickness at the same time and recover/die over the next 14 days. there will still be infectious people around. so how long does the battle gets drawn out for? 1 month, 3 or 6? it is not indicative to be the quickest solution or even the cheapest solution. 

2) duration the immunity last. you covered that, and expressed a 1 year duration. that i believe to be reasonable, since covid or the flu immunity do not last very long. but what if it only last 3~6 months? coupled with the time factor above, it would all end up for nothing. 

3) herd immunity as a defensive measure undermines what other countries (nearly whole world) are doing in terms of flattening the curve. indonesia will probably be  in every country travel ban, or even have to declare self lockdown still. 

4) virus mutation. h1n1 apparently being the next most recent outbreak, proved the success of herd immunity. but, thats due to the virus mutating to be “milder” suddenly? what if covid remains the same or mutate higher, such that previous immunity dont work. i think mutation is a numbers game. giving it more cases, really just gives it room for bigger badder chances too.

=== Author: samglit===
Imperial College modelling assumes herd immunity will set in within 3 months if the virus is allowed to run its course.

Indonesia is letting this happen by default anyway - it’s about predicting economically what will happen in the coming year. “This is not the best way” isn’t really a relevant consideration since we don’t control Indonesia and they are going to do what they are going to do, which looks like shambling through this.

Once a population is herd immune, there’s no need to continue a lockdown or prevent travel. It’s no longer relevant.  That’s what the UK was trying to do before being scared by the number of deaths that would happen to get there “naturally”.

Also, lots of 3rd world countries have pretty poor life expectancies anyway, they might not have so many 80+ year olds left which might skew mortality down.

> # Coronavirus: NUS and NTU let students write off grades for modules this semester

> SINGAPORE - The two largest universities in Singapore are letting students write off their grades for modules this semester, to ease anxieties about disruptions to learning amid the coronavirus outbreak.

> The National University of Singapore (NUS) is allowing undergraduates to exercise the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) option for up to 10 modular credits for any module taken this semester.

> This translates to about two typical modules, and excludes final-year projects, honours theses and equivalent modules.

> The S/U option allows a student to take a course and attain the modular credits for graduation, without receiving a letter grade.

> The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also let undergraduates use the S/U option, but for all courses this semester.

> In the light of the Covid-19 situation, the universities had moved large lectures and some assessments online.

> They had also recalled students on overseas placements, such as exchange programmes and internships.

> The Education Ministry had said the institutions would address students' concerns about the loss of credits earned during their exchanges or placements.

> In an e-mail to students on Wednesday (March 25), Professor Ling San, NTU's deputy president and provost, said: ""We acknowledge and understand the concerns and anxieties you are feeling about your education and learning at NTU due to the uncertainties posed by the Covid-19 situation.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Singaporean overseas students scramble for flights home after schools issue blanket recall

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> ""Your faculty and I have been listening to your feedback and comments made to us directly and through various platforms.""

> In the circular seen by The Straits Times, he said that only content taught up to week 10 of the semester will be tested in exams and continual assessments.

> Deadlines will be spaced out, he said, adding that students will be seated 2m apart during examinations.

> For in-class assessments such as quizzes and tests, students will be placed in alternate seats and in alternate rows.

> NUS provost Ho Teck Hua told students in an e-mail on Wednesday: ""The Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact Singapore and the NUS community. We understand the additional stress this has caused you over the course of this semester.""

> The 10 S/U modular credits are on top of the grade-free first year that NUS students already have.

> ""We hope that this change in the university's S/U policy, made in close consultation with NUS Students' Union, will help you get more out of your learning experience during this difficult time,"" said Professor Ho.

> Yale-NUS College, which sits within NUS, has also allowed students to exercise the S/U option for any module taken this semester.

> Professor Joanne Roberts, the college's executive vice-president (academic affairs), said: ""However, students have been cautioned to seek advice from their academic adviser that choosing such an option may impact how a future professional or graduate school views their transcript.""

> The college has been closely monitoring the situation and communicating with students to understand their challenges, she said.

> ""As a community of learning, this means helping our students focus on learning while setting aside, as far as we can, their worries about achievement metrics,"" she added.

> NUS second-year social work student Jazreel Tay, 21, said most students are glad that the university is providing the S/U option this semester.

> “It’s a good move that NUS is allowing us to S/U certain modules, but not all. There is some leeway for students to cope with the disruptions, but also be motivated to continue studying and not totally give up,” she said.

> Her lectures this semester had gone online, and so will her final examinations starting at the end of April.

> “For online assessment based on memory work, you can’t stop people from referring to notes at home or cheating.

> “Maybe with this S/U option, students will be less likely to do that, because they are not as pressured to do well knowing there is a safety net to fall back on,” she added.

The world is not B&W but the government can be B&W. The government is not the world.

Someone could be using a fake work permit or revoked work permit and the property owner would still be liable. Do you think the government cares? The government is a machine, not a human being who could empathize. If you tell them you were tricked by an overstayer, they'll ask you to prove it.

Remember the drug mule Yong Vui Kong? Yes, he was an idiot to do what he did. But his case demonstrates governmental B&W. Because he was only 19-yo, the trial judge asked the prosecution to consider reducing the charge but they just declined. It took a lot of people supporting his case, dramatic events and a few years for his case to get a bit of mercy. Without the publicity and support, he might not have gotten the mercy. Right or wrong, that's governmental B&W right there at least by the prosecutor.

Here's my thoughts on the current situation. Considering the continuous rise in numbers of confirmed cases in Singapore and around the world, the situation in Singapore seems even more critical now as we recall even more Singaporeans even back home - the next 2 weeks will truly determine the fate of this outbreak.

As local clusters still begin to form, and the number of untraced cases over the past few days continue to rise, our resources grow scarce and it becomes much harder to deal with the situation, despite the social distancing measures that the government has employed. Some companies have begun to trial work-from-home initiatives, but I still feel that the numbers are still insufficient in dealing with this critical situation as there are still many companies out there who will not do anything until the government forces them to do so by adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach. Albeit, such measures will likely cause huge disruptions to our lives and our economy, but in the face of Singapore closing its borders to all short-term visitors, working from home as an alternative pales in comparison to the seriousness of this situation and companies should be socially responsible in adopting such policies. Many people have complained about how the social distancing measures enacted this week - in which they do not appear to be very feasible? Just look at the number of people on the packed trains during peak hour.

Similarly, in the case of schools. It seems ridiculous for the government to encourage all companies to adopt a work-from-home policy when they still insist upon not closing schools. I feel that especially nowadays, especially as most people have sufficient technology in accessing e-learning platforms (and those left out have facilitated access by schools), e-learning is the right way to go instead to minimise social contact in schools. Come on, look at the social distancing measures adopted in schools - on paper it looks feasible, but if you look at the reality, with over a thousand school-going children continuously interacting still despite staggered breaks etc., it seems like a hotbed for spreads. Wipe-down measures are recommended but left to the elderly cleaners (who have been said to be the most susceptible) and the most questionable decisions are to go to school and sit in the classrooms to do e-learning, in which there is bare minimisation of social contact.

Admittedly, MOE's concern of disrupting parents' work, especially for those working in the healthcare sector, is valid, but in this point of time, asking people to work from home but leaving children in schools may not be the most feasible idea. Why can't we just leverage upon our technological capabilities to keep everyone safe and still prevent our economy from coming to a standstill? Let us be more socially responsible and truly understand the situation overseas - where death tolls have been continuously mounting and understand how lucky we are for now with timely measures - but more severe ones must surely be taken.

Dear Singaporeans, let us tide through this entire situation safely. What are your thoughts?",2020-03-23 00:05:43,"

I agree there is scope for discussion around this topic. SG is pursuing quite a different strategy from other nations. Time will tell whether it was smart or foolish. At the moment they are still holding well, and the evidence (cases, deaths) point to a viable strategy that they can continue.

I believe much of their decisions revolve around the single concept that this pandemic might stretch for months and months and months. Hence they postulate the scenario during planning: what if the schools are closed for 6 months, what will happen? when will it end? what is the indicator to close schools, what is the indicator to open schools? Have you considered this?

This is the same criteria for all other measures they are taking. 

Similar for work, they are discouraging travel, but not total lockdown. I believe we will see first a single-school lockdown, and if it spreads, then multiple schools, the entire school system. Alternatively, temporary short 'brakes', like a 14 day stop school, instead of perpetual. 

They have indicated many times they have lots of different options, but everyone keep asking, why not total lockdown, as if there are no other choices. 

If we get a crazy 1000 person local community transmission overnight all over the island without any trace, I am sure they will do the temporary lockdown.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
Okay, let’s try to answer a few questions before we proceed:

1) How long will the covid situation last? 

2) Do the benefits of a lockdown outweigh the costs?


Well, we don’t know how long it will last, when it will end, so you can’t go on a lockdown with no deadline. The situation is really not THAT bad to warrant a lockdown yet, although it might worsen. Do we know if it will worsen? No we also don’t. 

Now what benefits do a lockdown provide? It gives a temporary, and emphasis - TEMPORARY, relief to curb the virus from spreading. Will it mean the virus completely does not spread? No. Will the virus completely stop spreading when the time to end the lockdown comes? Don’t know. When do we end the lockdown? Don’t know too. 

This means complete economic uncertainty. You’re asking the government to promote economic uncertainty and inefficiency when it is already guaranteed we will enter a recession this year. A lot of people will lose their jobs. If you want the economy to return to normalcy as soon as the virus situation is over, then a lockdown is really not the best way. 

Ultimately a lockdown may occur, but everything is about the timing. Going straight into a lockdown now may bring more harm than delaying it by, say, two weeks. 

The situation is bad but it really isn’t THAT bad yet. YET. So wait and see will be the right thing. 

Now when will be the “right” time then? My guess would be when the number of unlinked cases start to rise, or (touch wood) even explode. Then that would definitely warrant a lockdown. For now, no. 

For example, look at the big hoo-ha surrounding that VJC teacher case. Did any other related cases explode from there? Did any VJC students get infected? Not that we know of, right? It’s okay to be careful, but letting fear overrule logical decisions and mathematical probabilities would really not be the ideal thing to do in this climate.

on the face of it it's not sufficient

but do u really think we can pull off a Wuhan-style complete lockdown? cos its the only way to prevent crowded trains and school

a lot of ppl have talked about the white elephant of public transport...so you can't have crowds if u ban all buses and trains \*taps head\*

look at the number of ppl at hawker centres during the weekends, should there be a compromise?

E learning is nowhere near sufficient as of now.  Im currently developing E learning modules for my workplace to onboard new hires and already its taken a few months.   I cant imagine how long it will take to develop a coherent syllabus for multiple subjects.  Also,  the company that develops the platform, BlackBoard, happens to be Wizlearn Tech which was one of the clusters.


E learning requires resources and time to develop, and it wont be ready for another couple weeks if not months to be able to sufficiently conduct lessons the way it is done in class.  

Zoom teleconferencing on the other hand, is a more viable option. Set a time, and have students log on and attend. Their tech is stable, audio is clear if everyone else except the teacher is muted, and can share notes , post questions, discuss, etc

=== Author: mburg777===
Let’s get this out of the way. 

School closure is not the answer. 

Children do not watch themselves at home. 

Parents will have to take care of them. 

This means frontline HCWs and other essential services will lose manpower. 

There is already a strain on frontline HCW manpower, so it’s not a good idea. 

Children who are home may not stay home either. The parents might be tempted to bring them to Universal Studios or a playgym or go shopping perhaps. 

There is also no widespread local transmission. Most of the cases are imported - Singaporeans returning back from overseas. 

Closing down the city will impact many people’s livelihoods unneceaaarily. 

The policy makers consider these aspects of the issue and I think they made the right choice to keep schools open.

=== Author: YipJK===
As a student, I regretfully have to inform you despite all the talk on the current state of our e-learning platforms, even as a student you can tell the teachers and schools have little confidence on the performance of the platform compared to that of traditional methods. Even in schools that are comparatively very innovative and accepting of new technologies and their implementation in schools, I'm looking at schools like Nan Chiau Pri that had a very innovative mobile learning system previously, I doubt it surprises anyone that they still prefer traditional schooling so long as the current state of education with its hard focus on continuous written papers and examinations persist.

And even if they were, let's be real, the people with the least confidence on this system is the parents. Would they really trust their kid alone at home in front of a screen to study?

=== Author: Skythewood===
Here's the facts so far;        
      
Total cases: 430      
Active cases: 290     
Imported cases: 228     
Non import: 62      
        
What does each of these numbers mean and which is more important? First, active cases is more important than total cases, since it represents the current situation more accurately. And active cases can be broken down to imported or local cases.     
           
Next, imported cases will have lessser impact than non import. These includes sg residents MFA rescued from overseas and tested/quarantined immediately.     
      
Last is the most important of them all, local cases. They are the most likely to spread the virus to others in sg, with each case potentially creating a cluster.    
        
So in my opinion, 62 local cases isnt cause for panic yet, and with the ban on short term visits, it seems manageable.     
         
I might be wrong though, feel free to refute anything i posted.

As a student, my own personal opinion is that MOE’s actions are now looking increasingly insufficient.

First, like what you mention, thousands of students congregate within a school during school hours. From what I observe in my JC, students bottleneck at school entrances in the morning where the risk of transmission for pathogens is inherent. Moreover, prior to the March holidays, I have witnessed throngs of students queueing for food in the school canteen. Crowds exceed whatever I have personally witnessed in hawker centres on weekends or shopping malls during recess periods. Even with social distancing measures implemented by MOE, such forms of contact and crowding are in a sense inevitable given constraints to infrastructure and timetabling.

In addition, classes are still packed. Each class contains around 25-30 students who stay in close proximity to each other throughout the day. It is borderline impossible to uphold government regulations of 1 metre spacing between people because of classroom venue size and other constrains.

Second, I feel that my experience in school is being affected immensely, to the point where closing schools may make students better off. With the new measures implemented over the holidays and fixed seating, my recess timings have been affected. I will have to share a canteen bench with another class and it just so happens that the bench can only accommodate one class at once. Yet, my recess timings clash on some days with this class meaning that there may not be enough space for my class to consume food. Moreover, activities in class such as group discussion and other project style activities have greatly reduced. With CCAs being cancelled as well, I would have to say these measures have adversely affected interaction with peers. 

Given all these factors, I really feel as if travelling to school jeopardises my safety and I believe it may be time to seriously consider closing schools. This is just my own personal opinion based on what I feel and observe from my JC.

=== Author: DaFitNerd===
Students don't stop existing when schools are shut. Teenagers will end up going out to hang out with their friends, especially if the closure lasts longer than a couple of weeks, which is looking increasingly likely considering what's happening in the UK, HK, etc. 

It's either letting them roam or an adult needing to stay at home. Plus contact tracing in schools is much easier than in the public, and I'm sure students are constantly nagged by teachers to maintain some standard of personal hygiene.

=== Author: winterdates===
Agree. It will be very difficult to enforce adequate physical distancing among school children. 

School will eventually be closed once cases increased.

Government can come out with measures to provide assistance or monitoring to families where the parents need to be at work e.g. healthcare workers.

=== Author: retaki===
How about making schools (primary + secondary) dual sessions again (morning and afternoon) like the primary schools in the past? 

As there are no CCA for now, school hours can be stretched. Maybe some classes can be held in morning, some in afternoon. Or all odd register number morning session/ even ones attend afternoon session.
 
+ It could reduce crowding by half.

- school staff might have a longer working hour
- might have many implementation details to be worked out

=== Author: smalldog257===
The government seems to be good in taking an evidence-based approach. Whenever they see a particular mode of transmission they act to shut it down: seniors' activities, mosques, imported cases.  So far there is no evidence of any spread in schools and children do not seem easily susceptible to the virus (I believe only about 2% of all cases in Singapore are under the age of 20).

=== Author: Intentionallyabadger===

=== Author: jupiter1_===
Certain companies cannot WFH - and I believe at least 1/2 of the economy cannot.

If schools are closed, these parents will need to find arrangements to lookafter the kids. Worst if cannot go work and then business will stop. Just impossible to make this decision.

Right now, we can only really take temperature and keep monitoring

No. Social distancing is not happening. People are travelling. RIP

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Honestly, I feel that even if students in Singapore don't have lessons for 6 months it's fine. They could be behind but they can catch up.

The issue here is Singapore is trying to reduce business impact as well as contain the spread of the virus.
Like you said, if school close, parents need to take care of them which might affect the parent's work. If parents leave them be, some of them are going to meet anyways.


In your post, I don't see a solution give that meets the government's and people's need. If there isn't a balance between economical impact and controlling the virus I doubt the government will do anything too drastic

March school holidays can be extended.

They are already much more unlinked cases.

Let's be truthful, the only reason why schools are not lock down is because it is socially disruptive to working parents / single parents / shift workers.

In my opinion, there is a drastic lack of social support for school closures, and it shows how unprepared we are when it boils down to it. Everyone needs to help out, and most are unwilling.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
Get ready for a ton of down votes. We all know Singaporeans care more about exams and business than the health of the general populace.

Have you ever tried staying at home for 6 months straight? Your productivity and will to live will fucking rot.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
1) Until when will you extend the holidays? How many weeks? Will the situation be better then?

2) There is no “free” extension. Extending the March holidays means a shorter, or even complete removal of the June holidays. Students need a break, teachers also need a break. 

3) Exams cannot be postponed, unless you are asking the students to take their ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels next year. Students who are taking exams this year are severely disadvantaged. 

4) E-learning is a travesty. It’s ineffective, inefficient, and really unproductive. 

5) Teachers don’t get to work from home, but their kids are on stay home notice. If teachers work from home, they have to take care of their children.


Regarding your last point about the lack of social support, I guess I will have to agree with it to some extent. But it’s really not about support for school closures alone, because in this case you’re looking at a complete shutdown of the economy extremely abruptly - what you need is a superbly coordinated effort by every single member of society to support the lockdown, but we already know that is close to impossible (xia suay-ers, anybody?).

=== Author: lintra===
OP said total cases is 430, but active cases are at 290. That's where you get 62 local cases from.

=== Author: nicholas294===
Yes. Obviously I myself do not want curriculum time to be reduced as far as possible (it is my A level year) but given the current situation I feel that we should seriously consider closing schools.

=== Author: qbica===
shouldn't one increase frequencies so that its less crowded?

=== Author: rebeeep===
you're not wrong- many people will outwardly say that they're all for school closure and much stricter measures in order to make sg safer despite the fact that majority of them would rather prioritize their studies and work.

To be fair though, even though the situation is dire, school closure would fuck up both my education and the education of many others taking major exams this year- if we're being honest, SLS just ain't cutting it man

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
This is the problem when people starts to toss numbers that aren’t defined properly in forums like this. It isn’t 62 non imported cases. It is 62 active cases derived from local transmission. It makes a big difference when you think about it and it would be seen as an attempt to be down playing the actual numbers.

Edit : OP mentioned non imported instead of local

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
It isn’t FACTS when you are providing numbers that are ill defined/ mislabeled to promote your agenda or hypothesis. It is just plain intellectual dishonesty.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
I understand your frustrations. I guess at this point the opportunity costs associated with a lockdown are simply too huge, and really, I don’t think teachers want to cope with the travesty that is E-Learning, and many of them probably have their own families (with kids) too. They can’t teach you when their kid is running around at home needing their care.

I still can't find anywhere that states this is ""the greatest trial the church has ever faced"" or anywhere that implies that not attending mass is more dire than the Covid situation. Even in the paragraph you quoted, how does making the sacrifice of not going to mass equate to ""not attending mass is more dire than the Covid situation""?

Infact, the Catholic Church was the very first religious organization to call for a suspension of services way before the government made it compulsory for all religious gatherings to be suspended. If the church considered suspension of mass to really be more dire than the Covid situation, the services would still be continued till the government stepped in, like what most other religious organizations did.

=== Author: unsynchedcheese===
Which is why I said nothing about what the Catholic Church did. I'm finding fault entirely with how William Goh phrased his letter.

The letter literally says that not having mass is ""the greatest sacrifice of all"", which implies that it is a greater sacrifice than, say, dying. Which sounds quite dire to me.

It certainly puts into perspective what it must feel like to be a resident of N Korea or Kashmir.

I think Singapore residents have a false sense of security: they are emboldened by the thought that if anything happens to them, they are in line for some excellent free health care back home on their return. It is time to let them know that they will need to pay for their carelessness and anti-community spirit by paying for their own treatment fully with their medisave...as no insurance will cover them for COV19.

> # COVID-19: Measures being discussed for Singapore residents still travelling, says Wong

> SINGAPORE – The government is discussing measures to address Singapore citizens and residents who are still travelling despite its advisory to defer all travel.

> In a doorstop with media on Sunday (22 March), Minister of National Development and coronavirus multi-ministry taskforce co-chair Lawrence Wong said, “Any Singapore resident who may still choose to travel despite the advisories being raised to the highest level, I think there needs to be consequences.

> “We are already trying to digest this wave of returning Singaporeans. If we have to face a third, fourth or fifth wave, it will be very challenging.”

> Prior to this, he had announced that Singapore will be closing its borders to all short-term visitors from 11.59pm on Monday. These visitors will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore.

> Earlier, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced that eight Singaporeans had arrived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from Tehran, Iran. They had boarded a repatriation flight arranged by the Malaysian government for its nationals.

> The Singaporeans will serve a 14-day quarantine in Kuala Lumpur, as required by the Malaysian health authorities before returning to Singapore, the MFA said in its press release.  

> “The Singapore government would like to express our deepest appreciation to the Malaysian government and the Embassy of Malaysia in Tehran for accepting our request to help evacuate the Singaporeans from Iran.”

Government already given ""advice"" to defer non essential travel but there's still good with the ""paid already, cannot waste money"" and the ""already applied leave and company won't give back"" mentality. You see them here on reddit as well.

As for government I believe the direction now used to be that LOA due to shn or quarantine is not deductible from leave. However, direction now is that shn as a result of non essential travel is taken from leave.

Hopefully we get less idiots thinking that traveling out during school holiday is a necessity

I suppose it could be hard to draw the line between essential and non-essential travel. Holidays are definitely non-essential, but how about work trips, or visiting say sick parents? Which are essential and which aren’t? I’d think that this could be the reason why the govt isn’t implementing it. Short of a blanket travel ban, it’d be rather difficult to regulate.

I guess that’s why is advisory for ppl/company to decide when they approve leaves. Like you say holiday straight away reject. If it is work related company itself has to decide if it is essential or can solve by teleconference. Visit sick parents or see them one last time at ICU may need to discuss for work arrangement or other bcp plan if stranded back there.

Now, attending funeral is it essential or not essential? That is really hard for the company to decide for an employee. Rationally is a direct no since high risk besides the traveling and also the gathering, but on the other hand if you willing to apply leave to attend this funeral, that person must be special in your life...

THE DATA IS REAL, BUT I DO NOT CLAIM THAT THE CALCULATIONS AND MODELS  I'VE MADE HAVE ANY PROFESSIONAL SIGNIFICANCE.** This is just me  messing around with Microsoft Excel. I also do not mean to offend anyone  with the choice of data and choice of countries. **I am in no way criticising the measures carried out by the governments of these countries.** Keep in mind: **I am able to make mistakes, and I am sure that there are many flaws with my models.**

With that said, this post was originally inspired by [a Post from /r/DataIsBeautiful.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fn6czo/oc_maybe_an_interesting_different_way_of_looking/)

Sources of Data for Covid Patients in [Singapore from the Singapore Government](https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-cases-in-singapore#week-6:-24-feb---1-mar), and [China from Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/).

Now, let's begin.

I  think that people are (rightly so) worried at how much the Covid cases are increasing. Yes, the cases are rising exponentially,  and yes, this is just the beginning. Things are about to get much worse.

However, there is something interesting. You see, I read a [Post from /r/DataIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fn6czo/oc_maybe_an_interesting_different_way_of_looking/)  which showed the progression of Covid cases in different countries in a  different way. The original poster wanted to measure the ""acceleration""  of the Covid cases. If the ""acceleration"" decreased, it means that  whatever measures the country is taking to slow down the cases may be  working.

I've adapted the model  used by that poster into a simpler model. The increase in Covid cases in  each country can be thought of as an exponential curve, where **y = e \^ (c.x)**, where x is the number of days that have passed, and c is the ""constant"" of acceleration.

Therefore, to obtain the value of c for every day, we would need to calculate the natural logarithm:

ln y = c.x ln e ; which gives us **ln y = c.x**

Finally, we divide both sides by x in order to obtain the constant, **(ln y)/x = c**

What I've done then is plot this constant value against the number of days for each country. Let us begin first with **China**:

# [China's Data](https://i.imgur.com/rSt83so.png)

As you can see, for the first 21 days, China's cases were *somewhat* linear. But the interesting thing is that **the constant was decreasing day-by-day.**

This  is especially true when you look at the big picture and plot out the  data for 56 days. The curve for the number of cases ceases to be linear  and now there is a plateau. **The constant keeps decreasing everyday**. The goal is to get the constant as close to 0 as possible to reduce the amount of cases per day.

Therefore, it seems that the measures taken by the Chinese Government have been somewhat effective.

For the 56th day, China's constant was **0.201**

# [Singapore's Data](https://i.imgur.com/UYI0ghY.png)

The data in Singapore is... interesting. For the first 21 days, the increase was *somewhat* linear as well. However, the constant is erratic. It **can be argued that the constant for the first 21 days is** ***somewhat*** **linear** as well. Meaning that the Singapore government's **measures were somewhat successful in keeping the constant to 1 (on average).**

However, the full picture comes for 56 days. **It seems that the Singapore Government's measures for the last 14 days managed to reduce the constant**. If the authorities keep it up, they might be able to control the number of cases.

For the 56th Day, Singapore's constant was **0.269**

Again, I do not claim that this data is an accurate model of anything. It was just me messing around in Excel.",2020-03-23 20:48:52,"

rubbish in, rubbish out

if the data is not accurate, you first have to clean it, or else whatever analysis that follow is rubbish.

the reported infection, is a reflection of the actual cases, the testing ability, and the truthfulness of the reporting authority. using an exponential growth model, is merely only trying to model the actual cases, while ignoring the rest of the factors.

i am not sure the purpose of this thread. is this an education experience or a showcase of analysis. on one hand, you titled the thread as ""a different way of looking at data"" and you start giving out some numbers and conclusion. then on the other hand, you are hiding behind disclaimer of your inexperience.

=== Author: boileroom===
Oops sorry about my previous comment. Doubt AR process is the right one you should be looking at.
  
Probably just recursive substitution.
  
Number of cases today = number of cases yesterday X r-nought(r) —> Yt = rYt-1 + et; Yt-1 = rYt-2 + et-1.
  
Therefore, Yt = r^(k)Yt-k + (et+ret-1+...+r^(k)et-k) - edit: edited the error term. this error looks like a MA process.
                     
    
Try to find r using different country’s data set. And compare which is more efficient. 
  
Or if you wanna test if safety measures implemented have an effect then probably look at dates of implementation, and track the segments between no measures up to an implementation. And compare that with the segment that follows. First day of implementation to the date implementations are added or taken down.

Well how do you ""clean"" the data that is provided by governments? I don't think that the Chinese Communist Party is a saint either, they've obviously toyed around with their data to make themselves look good. But hey, it's the only thing that's available.

Okay, let's ignore the whole constant curve and just use the No. reported cases vs Days. China seems to have stopped the exponential growth of their cases. We don't know how, we don't know what, but we can see that *something* happened around the 30th day which caused the curve to flatten. If the CCP is lying about this, well, then they'll have a taste of karma just like in the beginning when dr. Li tried to warn everyone but nobody listened.

As for the Singapore government, they are much more transparent than the CCP. Unless of course you're implying that we can't trust them either, in which case I'd just give up. Again, ignoring the constant curve, we can see that the growth is still exponential to this day. We don't know what or why (perhaps the huge influx of returning students from overseas), but we do know that it is still happening.

You can throw all the funny stuff to the error term, but that would invalidate your model. when you create a model, the model usually assume the error is normally distributed, and does not change with time. when the error of your fitted model does not follow the error assumption, your model is rubbish.

I know there is one day that china suddenly add 10k cases because china clinically diagnose that as COVID case, and then they later remove that definition. this would mess with your error term, invalidating the model.

i am not sure what u mean by error is significant...

=== Author: blizstorm===
my advice to you, if you are interested in such anaylsis, is to get a solid foundation first. there are too many bad analysis floating around the world already. understand well what is bias, variance, linear regression model, model validation before even moving onto exponential growth model.

if the data is totally bad, just throw it away. a top analyst, is able to get data from elsewhere to question the original data. so to question china data, try thinking of more ways to question the data. as you said, one way is just to wait out and see if COVID blows up in china. Another, is to look at the people evacuated from Hubei. At all time, be aware of the bias at work and seek to adjust them.

in my opinion, trying to produce good analysis for COVID for public consumption currently is too difficult. you should just pick a simpler learning project

Airline crew are most at risk, more so compared to healthcare workers who are trained to be careful. 

Airline crew work in closed environment for hours with recycled air (aircon), and now there are so many imported cases each day who are most likely on the plane (where else?). 

You need to contact the airline and let them know. If the airline already knows, then you've done your part.

=== Author: seeyou-bye===
People who has been to Australia aren't issued SHN yet.

As for layovers in Australia (not too sure about other countries), you just have to stay in the airport or self-isolate in the accomodation. So if the cafes are in the airport it's fine, if not your friend is socially unresponsible. Take into consideration that the guidelines for self-isolation only applies to visitors after 15 march, so if your friend was there beforehand, s/he are still fine.

Regardless, we should all just try to avoid crowded places and practice social distancing. If your friend is so irresponsible, maybe you shouldn't meet up with that friend or that has close contact with. Not that many peole cared anyway, still see queues for Zouk and Marquee.

> # Parliament: Coronavirus cases to rise as more overseas Singaporeans return home, says Gan Kim Yong

> SINGAPORE - The number of coronavirus cases will continue to rise in coming weeks, as some of the 200,000 overseas Singaporeans return home, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday.

> He noted that the number of cases in Singapore has more than doubled in the past week, from 266 to a total of 558 currently.

> ""Almost 80 per cent of these new cases were imported, all from countries other than China even though we continued to see around 1,000 residents and long-term pass holders return from China in the past week,"" he said.

> As of Tuesday, there were more than 370,000 Covid-19 cases and over 16,500 fatalities from the disease worldwide, with the epicentre shifting from China to Europe.

> In his ministerial statement in Parliament, Mr Gan said Singapore has slowed the spread of Covid-19 through a three-pronged approach: reducing importation, detecting and isolating cases early, and emphasising social responsibility and good personal hygiene habits.

> Firstly, Singapore has implemented border controls to stem the inflow of travellers - all short-term visitors, including tourists, have been barred from entering or transiting since Tuesday.

> The Government also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel until the global situation is under control.

> It has strengthened border checks to detect and isolate cases before they come into contact with the wider community, and taken steps to detect cases early through surveillance at hospitals, polyclinics and the network of Public Health Preparedness Clinics.

> Singapore residents have benefited from more than 267,000 subsidised attendances at these clinics so far, on top of those at polyclinics, Mr Gan said.

> Related Story 49 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, of which 32 are from overseas

> Related Story Singapore residents who continue to travel abroad will pay full hospital charges if warded for coronavirus

> Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far

> He added that Singapore has also carried out around 39,000 tests for Covid-19 to date.

> This translates to 6,800 tests per million people in Singapore, compared with around 6,500 in South Korea, and 1,000 in Taiwan.

> These tests are key in detecting as many cases as possible and as early as possible, he said.

> ""How the outbreak develops globally will depend on the strategies and efforts of countries around the world,"" Mr Gan said, noting the World Health Organisation has advised that the course of the pandemic can still be changed if all countries take the necessary containment actions.

> ""Otherwise, we will continue to see the number of affected countries and cases rise rapidly.""

> The top three sources of imported cases to Singapore are the United Kingdom, the United States and Indonesia, Mr Gan said.

I don’t think they are people who decided to go on holiday during this period. In any event, the 200,000 overseas Singaporean figure seems accurate, this was already the figure in 2017 (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Singaporean) - I’m not sure how you got the 10% figure though, considering there are about 3.5million Singapore citizens. 

Also, these are Singaporeans living in foreign countries who are caught in an unfortunate situation. Why should they be barred from entering their home country?

=== Author: WayneTai===
Certaintly not because of low prices. I think most people wont risk their health to save a few bucks. Some of us are working abroad.

=== Author: FitCranberry===
even more live permanently overseas, its not a new thing

=== Author: RazeXIX===
That is the total overseas Singapore residents / pr count. Some have already returned , and it is unlikely all will come. I wonder if the bulk have returned yet or ...

=== Author: VPee===
Sometimes the safest is to stay put where you are. Many other countries like India have barred travel for all irrespective of whether they are citizens or otherwise.

=== Author: RazeXIX===
That is the rational thing, but i know several people who did travel. Several of my friends who lived in sg in the past used the opportunity to come here, and now they are stranded in a foreign country while their own countries go on lockdown. People really have no foresight.

=== Author: VPee===
For those working abroad why would they come back to Singapore especially now?

=== Author: IAm_Moana===
I would not agree, especially if I were in the US, UK, or Italy. Being in Singapore would be exponentially safer. 

And to be clear, while India shut down international flights over the weekend, they did not (or cannot) ban non-citizens from leaving India. That means, if Singapore citizens can find a means out of the country (for example, through a government evacuation), they will be free to leave. 

This is the same logic for Singaporeans in countries under lockdown now - a Singaporean citizen in Malaysia right now will be able to drive across the Causeway back into Singapore, but will not be able to go back into Malaysia during the period of lockdown. 

Quarantine returnees if you will, but I definitely don’t think they should be barred from entering Singapore. I don’t think it’s even legally possible to bar Singapore citizens from entering Singapore.

=== Author: septeal===
coz the situation in their respective countries are worse?

=== Author: VPee===
Legally Singapore can only allow someone to enter if they fall at the doorsteps (airport immigration). The question is how will they reach if the flights etc are all stopped.
I don’t think the government will be evacuating people from other countries because that’s a double whammy - it costs tremendous money, energy and time to take up such activities and secondly the same cannot be channelled into fighting the existing battles with the virus within the country.
The current data clearly shows that most of the current cases are imported from other countries so the probability of them having the virus is very high. In that circumstance if all of the 200,000 people have to be quarantined and also tested that’s gonna suck a huge amount of resource.

I guess there is no right or wrong answer here but difficult situations require drastic measures. I believe the government is willing to take some hard stands to protect the entire country, even at the cost of a few votes not coming their way.

=== Author: heil_to_trump===
A government ***cannot*** bar entry to one of its citizens because doing so would leave one stateless. It is the intrinsic right of citizens to be able to enter and live in the country.

From Kuik Shiao-yin's fb post on 17 march:

>An economic winter is coming for many of them. For some, it is  already here and it is frightening. The news focuses on the huge  industries like aviation and tourism players potentially going bankrupt  and less so on the smaller players.  
>  
>Profiles of those who are also getting hit terribly:  
>  
> \- Those who work in SMEs facing the trickle down effect (those who earn  under 100m or employ <200 workers but contribute to 48% of SG’s GDP,  employ 65% of SG’s workforce and constitute 99% of all SG’s  enterprises.)  
>  
>\- Those who freelance and do gigs (freelance creatives, musicians, actors, food delivery, etc)   
>  
> \- Those whose work depends on having medium to large sized groups of  people show up (events managers and organisers, conference organisers  and support, trainers, teachers, F&B, film crews, small  renovation/contractor firms, party planners, arts-based companies etc)  
>  
> \- Those who run events that are too easily and unfortunately deemed  “non-essential” (social enterprise CSR events, creative work like  theatre, film music, celebrations etc)  
>  
>\- Those who work in hospitality, F&B, tourism, aviation, trade  
>  
>**There are some ways you can help:**  
>  
> 1. Ask them how their work has been hit by the Covid crisis. If they’re  doing badly, ask them if you can financially support them somehow. **Find  ways to commission work from them or ask around on their behalf.** Pay  them fairly and generously for their work. Bonus: You never know if the  thing you’re commissioning from them can also be the financial and  psychological invitation they need to explore a pivot in their business.    
>  
>2. If you’re one of the luckier ones who are actually not  worried now and are sniffing for cheap, plummeting stocks to invest in  so you can get even richer, consider investing in people around you who  exhibit great potential. I’m not talking about pity investments. I mean  **thoughtful intentional investments that support Singapore’s economic and  societal well-being**. Consider using some of your significant loose  change to be a mini venture capitalist or mini impact investor.  
>  
> 3. **Tip the gig economy people** you come across - like your food delivery  person, your taxi driver, your part-time waiters and food servers. Be  more generous than normal. Tipping has never been our culture but the  option has been built into the apps’ system if we choose to use it.  There are many around us who are forced to choose between taking medical  rest and keeping up their hourly paid work. Tip them so they know if  they are sick especially with flu like symptoms, they have some kind of  financial relief and psychological permission from someone to stay home  and rest.   
>  
>4. If you bought tickets to a local theatre  performance/concert/workshop that got cancelled, **if it is possible for  you and you have more than enough, don’t harass them for refunds**  especially if you know they are a smaller player without deep pockets.  
>  
> 5. If you are a big corporate/govt agency that has to cancel your  events and workshops (especially those CSR events run by smaller social  enterprises), pay them something - anything. In exceptional times,  explore how to make an exception to the usual contractual rules. Write  in a new goodwill clause if you want. **Pay them a goodwill amount** \- your  generosity could mean some employees get paid. This is **especially for  social enterprises which hire the elderly or people with special needs**.  If possible don’t cancel but postpone the event and still pay upfront as  a gesture of solidarity.  
>  
>6. **If your friends are running F&Bs, go dine-in (at an appropriate distance). Or order takeaway/catering from them.**   
>  
> 7. If you run some kind of community group or religious group  especially, find a way to **gently and kindly ask if there is anyone going  through hard times in their business who needs some help**. You’ll be  surprised how many real needs are there in front of you even amongst  those who look comfortably middle class. People may stay quiet and stoic  because the global situation seems so dire out there and they feel  their own hyper-local needs seem smaller in comparison.

Case 90

Case 90 is a 75 year-old female  Singapore Citizen who has no recent travel history to China. She is  currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for  Infectious Diseases (NCID). She is linked to the cluster at The Life  Church and Missions Singapore.  


She reported  onset of symptoms on 9 February and had sought treatment at a general  practitioner (GP) clinic on 9 February, 17 February and 23 February. She  was conveyed in an ambulance to the emergency department at Tan Tock  Seng Hospital on 23 February, where she was immediately isolated.  Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 23 February  afternoon.   


Prior to hospital admission, she had mostly stayed at her home at Bishan Street 12. 

&#x200B;

Case 212   


Case 212 is an imported case involving a 64 year-old male  Indonesian national. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 14  March morning, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

R.I.P.

>The first patient was a 75-year-old female Singapore Citizen. She was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on 23 February for pneumonia, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on the same day. She had been cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU) since admission to NCID. She developed serious complications and eventually succumbed to the infection after 26 days in the ICU on 21 March at 7.52am. She had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension.

>The second patient was a 64 year-old male Indonesian national. He was admitted in critical condition to the ICU at NCID on 13 March, after arriving in Singapore from Indonesia on the same day, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 14 March. He had been cared for in the ICU since 13 March. He developed serious complications and eventually succumbed to the infection after nine days in the ICU on 21 March at 10.15am. Prior to his arrival in Singapore on 13 March, he had been hospitalised in Indonesia for pneumonia, and had a history of heart disease.

Matches up with cases 90 and 212:

Rest in peace. To all teachers and employers who are reading this, I plead to you to replace as many face-to-face close activities like group projects and discussions with remote activities. Yes, remote work may not be as efficient or effective as the in-person work. But many businesses and learning can still go on with remote work. Please prioritize safety over quality. At this moment, no one in the world would mind if your weekly work meeting is done remotely or if your course is conducted online. Please consider and be kind. Thank you.

Singaporeans should really start wearing masks. My Singaporean girlfriend went back to Singapore in early February for a few days and I was shocked when she told me only about 1 in 10 people had any type of personal protective gear on.

We're living in Hong Kong at the moment, so I've been following both countries stats since the beginning. Right now we're at 432 cases in Singapore and 274 cases in Hong Kong. While there is no debate that Singapore's government are doing a lot better than their Hong Kong counterpart, we are seeing the a lot more cases in Singapore than HK.

Both countries have a similar amount of population, similar population density (maybe HK has more population density), similar modes of public transportation, etc. The only differences are  Singapore has a competent government and Hong Kongers wear masks (about 90 - 95%).

I think Singaporeans should start being a little bit more proactive. If local shops and pharmacies don't have any masks, try and order from overseas which admittably will be more difficult now. There are reusable masks still available, they're not as recommended as the disposable ones but still offer people lots of protection from droplets. You can even DIY your own ones using cloth.

Stay safe everyone!

I am a PR from Indonesia btw, and the SG government had done a lot of works for the neighbouring country,eg; helping Malaysia stranded worker due to the lockdown, providing extra testing kits to country that need it. Never once politicing the event, rather just doing their best to help solve this issue ASAP.

=== Author: theswordofdoubt===
I'm not. A government's first priority should be looking after its citizens, before all others. That's why we elect our own leaders, why we trust and support them. A government that puts the interests and benefits of foreign peoples before their own is committing treason, and betraying the people who put their trust in them. 

As a Singaporean citizen, I would expect that if I fall ill or have any other misfortune befall me, my government should have the resources available to help me, before a non-citizen. 

Now, should the Singapore government be open to helping foreigners? Sure, but **it should never be at the cost of Singaporean lives**. If our medical resources are stretched too thin by foreign demands to treat Singaporeans, then it's unfortunate and regretful, but Singaporeans should come first in that triage.

No point pointing the blame to anyone. Nobody wants to pass the disease to anyone and the healthcare professional has done what they could. Should focus on the living and do what we can ourselves to put the pandemic under control.

Try to go out less often unless it is necessary? People of old age with medical conditions dont have the immune system to fight any type virus, especially one with no vaccine.

=== Author: adognow===
A heart attack is one of the most common causes of chronic heart disease. But it's not necessarily that everyone who has had the former will have the latter.

That being said, the same precautions apply to everyone. Just don't go out if unnecessary, wash your hands after you get home (but also frequently outside), and absolutely avoid areas that you have to remain in with large numbers of people - cinemas, clubs, the like. MRT? No choice.

It's not likely to get COVID from passing contact with infected people so that's fine. Asymptomatic persons are capable of spreading COVID, but given their asymptomatic nature, they are less likely to spread an infection.

The obvious measure was, and still is to keep out every foreigner for an indefinite period of time. 

But no, the government won't do it, because it wants to keep the economy afloat. 

It is thus a glaring revelation that the survival of the economy trumps the lives of its inhabitants - including everyone on this subreddit . 

The government is well aware the country's inhabitants are easily replaceable, compared to the time and effort required to rebuild, restore and rehabilitate a devastated economy.

Now take a while and let that sink into our heads.

Case 147  
 

Case 147 is an imported case involving a 64 year-old male  Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore on 7 March. He is currently  warded in an isolation room at NCID.    
 

He reported onset of symptoms on 3 March while he was in  Indonesia. He had a fever when he arrived at Seletar Airport, and  underwent a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint. He was conveyed by  ambulance to NCID on 7 March night, and subsequent test results  confirmed COVID-19 infection on 8 March morning.   
 

Prior to hospitalisation, he mostly stayed at his rental apartment in the Oxley Road area.

=== Author: valvaro===
Yes confirmed coming in with private jet, but not necessarily his. He can rent full hospitalised flight including doctor and nurses for $25K per trip.

I've seen so many patients in clinics and a lot of them have long adopted a lackadaisical attitude to their own health - many diabetics will be shifty or even outright lie about their diet control, for instance - something that is easily elucidated in a simple blood test. They'd lie to the doctor in some misguided attempt to achieve who-knows-what, since it's their health, not ours. Doctors can only advise them that far. A good tactic doctors use with male diabetics to try to elicit their adherence to dietary and medication factors is to tell them about the link between diabetes and erectile dysfunction - this usually makes them pay attention (for however long their attention span is, that is).

It's the same lackadaisical attitude in these people that is helping drive the crisis. Yesterday, [thousands of morons](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea6a37f500ae7da0af7c4add783ae24715d9817/0_327_4911_2947/master/4911.jpg?width=620&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=6d04f79ff8ea2c3220bcfaf112843a8b) here in Australia went to crowd a beach east of Sydney just because it was a Friday with good weather, when Sydney's state (NSW) recorded a 25% increase in cases in the last 24 hours.

Guilt-trip your parents if you have to. Tell them about all those grandkids they're never going to see if they're not going to stay home. Do whatever you see fit to keep them home. But I have an inkling that in the end, martial law is going to be required for many countries - hopefully Singapore is not among them. Malaysia is already threatening martial law and military deployment because 40% of people are openly defying government stay-at-home orders.

Taiwan banned export of masks 🤷‍♀️

=== Author: theswordofdoubt===
Does a country's government sell ventilators, or does that not fall under the purview of private manufacturers? And to reiterate the point I made in my last paragraph: Governments can certainly help foreigners, but ***it should not come at the cost of their citizens' lives***. And, you know, *we have helped other countries*. Before you go throwing up strawmen, do read everything you're presented with. 

My opinion is that a government should be looking after its own people. If Indonesian people, or any other foreign nationals who want to enter Singapore to make use of our medical facilities, cannot get equally good or better healthcare in their own countries, that is the concern of their governments. And if their governments have proven to be inadequate in handling this crisis, perhaps those people should then take this as an opportunity to have a closer look at who their leaders are and what they're doing. 

And lastly? If I went to another country seeking healthcare, I would not expect to be treated before that country's citizens. Same with any other resource I would ask of that country. Would it be nice to be treated? Sure, and I would greatly appreciate it if I were in that situation. But if I were refused, I would not condemn that nation or its people, nor would I blame them. It is not a foreign government's duty to aid me before its own citizens.

=== Author: bidet803===
I see where you're going with this, but that's exactly what we're seeing in other parts of the world right now, yeah? There are EU countries holding back medical exports or refusing to trade their medical supplies (with other EU nations I might add) because they need them for their own citizens. Precisely because these really are extraordinary circumstances. They're looking to secure their own self-interest - even survival - right now.

Which isn't to say that cooperation doesn't exist. China particularly seems to be emerging from the crisis and has been sending aid and exports. But only because they now have the excess capacity to do so. 

At the end of the day, I believe it's a tightrope between securing our own interests while maintaining good ties with the nations around us, whom we still need in the long run. I can't fault any government, tbh, who looks to the safety of their own citizens first.  It's exactly what they should be doing.

But if the other country has a shortage of ventilators, using his logic or not, they probably would not sell them to us anyway.

Private manufacturers and companies are still subject to the laws of the countries in which they are based.  For example, Taiwan banned all export of masks produced by its domestic companies.  (And Taiwan is the second-largest producer of masks in the world.)  


Singapore is very, very trade-dependent.  Compared to other countries, it has very limited domestic production.  Very naive to think that goods and services from other countries can still flow freely despite what governments may decree.  What Taiwan did with masks can be done by countries that have ventilator manufacturers.  (And indeed there are movements in this direction at the moment.)  


Healthcare is a service that everyone in the country deserves, yes.  But it is also a service that Singapore can trade and offer to strengthen its bargaining position (politically, economically) globally, especially in this situation.  (E.g. we offer medical and scientific expertise, test kits... other countries offer us other types of essential supplies (masks, ventilators).)  Healthcare is one of our weapons in this fight, and we have to recognize that it can be used in more than one way.

=== Author: Logi_Ca1===
>Does a country's government sell ventilators, or does that not fall under the purview of private manufacturers?

Judging by the whole Google-Huawei thing, I would hazard to guess that governments can indeed compel private manufacturers in their country not to sell to other countries. I can certainly imagine Trump telling American manufacturers to not export ventilators for reasons of national security.

65 is the usual ""convention"" for classifying someone as ""elderly"". If you had to pick a cutoff starting at 60 or 70 I would guess that most would go with 60.

👋 hi there, upvoted you both because both of you made valid points. Though I’m sure he/she wasn’t defending the Indonesian covid victim but instead *understanding* it from the other side. 

It’s wrong for sure, and selfish definitely. But we can admit seeing all these hoarders around the world how selfish humans can be at the slightest threat of being locked down... so given a scenario where if one has the money to travel to a first world country with a first world healthcare system who gives **FREE** testing and treatment(at that point of time to any confirmed cases)... many will take this ticket to save themselves. 

Once again, reiterating that we’re not saying he is right, but that he is just like most humans.. who look out for themselves first. :/

Not saying it's justified ofc.

> # HSA warns of e-commerce listings falsely claiming to prevent, treat COVID-19

> SINGAPORE — The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has found a significant number of e-commerce listings in Singapore selling products that falsely claim to be able to prevent or treat COVID-19.

> In a media release on Thursday (19 March), it said that these products included health supplements, herbs, traditional medicines and “clip-on” products. The listings would have claims such as their products can “strengthen the immune system against the coronavirus” or “prevent and cure coronavirus”.

> There is currently no evidence that these products can prevent or treat COVID-19, which is a new strain of coronavirus that scientists around the world are still finding a vaccine or cure for.

> HSA also detected listings of “rapid test kits” which claimed to be able to diagnose COVID-19 within 10 minutes. Such claims are false, as testing for COVID-19 can be done only by clinical laboratories or medical professionals in clinics and hospitals, in order to ensure accurate test results and diagnosis.

> Such product listings made up about half the number of more than 2,500 listings removed by HSA during Operation Pangea, an Internet-based enforcement action coordinated by Interpol between 3 and 10 March. HSA will take actions against the sellers of these products.

> During the operation, HSA intensified its surveillance online to detect and disrupt the sale of illegal health products. Adulterated lifestyle products such as weight loss pills, sexual enhancement medicines and cosmetic products comprised more than 32 per cent of the removed listings.

> HSA also found that there were sellers who attempted to evade detection by both HSA and the e-commerce platform administrators. These sellers advertised their products as common household brands of soaps and shampoos, when they were in fact medicinal products and creams.

> From 1 January to 10 March, more than 1,100 unique seller accounts have been issued warnings on the regulatory requirements that they have to comply with.

> Additionally, HSA’s investigations uncovered that some individuals were selling their leftovers or unused health products such as steroid creams, antibiotic creams and painkillers. Many of these individuals were first-time sellers who claimed that they were unaware that such products are prescription medicines that can only be prescribed by doctors.

> HSA said that the sale of prescription medicines by individuals is an offence under the Health Products Act.

> The public are advised to exercise caution when buying health products online. The products may be cheaper and appear to offer better value, but the lower price could be due to unsafe or inferior ingredients, poor manufacturing methods and sub-standard or unhygienic storage conditions. The products could also contain harmful or banned ingredients.

> Sellers may claim that their products have been developed based on “scientific studies” or “evidence”. Such claims often lack a robust scientific basis and cannot be verified. Consumers who use them may end up with a false sense of security and delay seeking treatment if they feel unwell.

> When buying health products online, consumers are advised to buy them from websites with an established retail presence in Singapore.

> Anyone who supplies such health products is liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be jailed for up to three years and/or fined up to $100,000.

> Those who encounter illegal, counterfeit or other suspicious health products are encouraged to contact HSA’s enforcement branch 68663485 or hsa_is@hsa.gov.sg.

These sellers should be at least given a temporary ban immediately. They knew what they were doing.

It would be great if the government or the e-commerce sites could implement something akin to what Sim Lim Square was doing to their errant tenants.

Lots of imported as usual. Wonder when this will drop

Wonder at what point will the overseas cases stop...wonder how many Singaporeans are still overseas and yet to come back....this will not stop until they are all home. Curious to know the % of imported cases Vs people coming back. At least they are getting picked up early

=== Author: r9440===
Does anyone know when these new cases returned to Singapore? Is it 2-3 weeks ago considering the incubation period? If that’s the case, does it mean this week’s returns might pop up as confirmed cases in 2-3 weeks? 

I have foreign friends who returned from UK and ASEAN countries 2 weeks ago but aren’t serving any SHN or QO. They narrowly avoided the 14-day backdate by a day or 2. Some have respiratory symptoms but they’re not seeking medical treatment (because they’re foreign students in SG) and I’m avoiding going to school altogether to avoid them. There are the same people who think that Singapore is overreacting in early February! It’s killing me that I can’t do anything about it.

=== Author: saperis===
Don’t think imported cases will drop anytime soon with a new plane on the way to UK to get people back. 

There are around 200k+ overseas Singapore residents ... so we are looking at maybe at least 2k more cases if they were all to return.

Can someone enlighten or correct me here:

- why are people and residents still suka suka travelling all over the world during times like these and then being a burden and bringing this back to SG? Maybe I’m not up to date on when the bans and restrictions take effect, but I see reports of people traveling in February, March, ...

Edit: grammar

=== Author: togrias===
Expect more imported cases as our overseas Singaporeans come home from US/EU.

I'm worried about the rising number of stray cases. That means a growing base of latent cases that our contact tracers are unable to detect. Hopefully they're minor and most recovered, but quite a number can still be spreading without anyone's knowledge.

=== Author: localinfluenza===
Wa kao. Why still got foreigners who are not residents?

May i echo the sentimemts that our public transport is the elephant in the room.

Edit: from an objective standpoint, has singapore government done ok? Yes.... but when there is a FLAW in the measures i dont think its wrong to address it. Lifes are at stake, you and mine, we constanly flaunt our militaristic deterrent force, so maybe we could be as prudent when it comes to this pandemic?

=== Author: 123dream321===
Don't whine and download the tracing app guys. Contact tracing is our main line of defence now to detect the spread early, do yourself and others a service. Early detections can save alot of us 🙏

Well, the number is increasing. It is a matter of time we reach to a 3 digit of new cases

47 seems high on first glance but note that with >80% imported, it's not that alarming. We should expect a spike in cases because we are recalling Singaporeans from the most affected regions around the world. :)

Two ways to deal with this. 

1. Limit the entry only for those who have a medical clearance from Covid-19.

2. Arrivals need to be at a secured facility for  2 weeks quarantine.

One infected foreigner entering the country is one too much.

Anyone holding their breath for the border to be closed to foreigners? I'm guessing not, based on past vote popularity.

Now consider the possibility that an incoming asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic individual could jolly well commute to his/her destination using the MRT instead of a taxi...

The same individual could also potentially infect, say 10 others, on the plane, who then disembark and also commute using the train...

Community transmission will not stop until drastic measures are taken, until the government prioritises lives over the GDP.

It'd be nice to scrap away the default 14-day SHN and replace with no travel to SG unless necessary. It will hurt tourism, so what? Tourism is suffering already now. No further harm in rejecting the so-called tourists and unnecessary business travelers.

Probably in a week or so. Most of us who are planning to return to Singapore either have already done it or will do so in the next week. It doesn't help that we can't trust medical institutions outside of Singapore right now.

Could just be one of the confirmed cases that they were close to on public transport or something like that though?

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
> Wonder at what point will the overseas cases stop...wonder how many Singaporeans are still overseas and yet to come back....this will not stop until they are all home.

**Disclaimer**: *This is purely my opinion as a layman*

My guess is that there is a small window before the West starts closing their airports. I suppose it would be about 2 weeks for those who want to return to do so. Give them another 2 weeks to show symptoms or not and this should be over in a month.

Social distancing that is happening now should show its effectiveness in 2 weeks as well. That is assuming that Singapore as a whole follows the guidelines and minimizes contact and the policy is actually well enforced.

If we can weather the next month we might start to see things improve.

They ""address"" the transportation issue by asking employers to introduce staggered hours, which is as good as no measures.  I need to reached office by 10am which is considered relatively late. When I boarded the train to town at 930am, the train is still full of ppl.

=== Author: troublechromosome===
Minister wayang la

=== Author: tubistboi===
Yes, you brought up a good point about Singapore being mostly populated by SMEs, who may not have the means, willpower or even familiarity with work from home solutions. I never advocated for public transport to be terminated, however, an increase in the frequency of vehicles and staggered working hours to limit the number of passengers in our public transport. I would like to hope that the government working on solutions, but if so, please hurry up, no need to be bogged down by bureaucracy and minute economic losses that will pale in comparison if an outbreak explodes.....

=== Author: GeshtiannaSG===
It’s a place where everyone is in close contact. It has never been considered as a source, because tracing is focused only on significant places, not even like someone who went to a coffee shop or supermarket. Public transport has never been considered during checking. Lifts have also never been considered.

This is significant because we have an increasing number of “unlinked” cases. Before the updates have stopped including places of residence, there was a pattern forming, where coincidentally, many of the unlinked cases were from the Jurong West area. Another link has been many unlinked cases have been people in their 50s.

=== Author: tubistboi===
I am not an expert but it may seem that when you pack a bunch of people together for more than 1 minute and someone who is infected coughs, the cough droplets would disperse and be inhaled by the people around no? So the potential is there no?

As to which whether there are really no cases of spread perhaps they are the so call unlinked cases? Transport is so dynamic and random i dont think they would be able to define a cluster per se.

=== Author: tubistboi===
Or perhaps the event has not occurred, one incident is all that it takes, you want to wait until it occurs, or prevent it before it occurs, you cannot wait until the incident has occurred and then start action, that is pure negligence ....

=== Author: Happyygirl===
How do you confirm if the spread is not via public transport though?

Isn’t there enough phantom cases to believe the spread can come from anywhere?

=== Author: tubistboi===
No choice but to tango with the virus then....

They do though. Close contacts of confirmed cases are served SHNs, right?

Edit: Just realized you meant that families should get SHN at the same time as the cases who end up being confirmed do. Makes sense, but I'm not certain how many SHNs end up not being confirmed so don't know what the trade-off looks like.

Yeap, I don't recall ever getting to verify checksums when downloading anything straight from the app store. But considering the emphasis on security, I won't be surprised that there is some software verification already built-in.

A more interesting problem is whether code auditing is enough to ensure that the code is safe. The fact that we have vulns published in open source code regularly, and that they can often be traced back several years of releases, suggests that it isn't enough to just release the code publicly.

Because I keep seeing people gathering despite being advised not to. I keep seeing people with poor hygiene in public places. All of these mistakes that keep happening. Personally, I've already done what I can to reduce my risk so I am not worried.

I think that this problem didn't have to happen but if things keep going on, best case scenario, it's a slow burn and we remain affected for quite a long time. Worse case scenario, we become like Italy. It could have been that we took very strict measures from the start and within 1 month, things become normal domestically. Bear in mind that our NCID beds are been stretched to their limit with this slow rise in cases, they will be stretched to the limit should things go south.

That's great. Apologies, just voicing my observations. I employ lots of foreign nationals (Being in R&D). The Chinese nationals are taking this very seriously - all are wearing masks, working from home etc. But a few of my other employees from Europe are planning to travel around Europe now cause its cheap.... thank god the SHM notice went and most cancelled their plans.

Good for you. 

In late January I spoke to an Italian about the seriousness of this pandemic. 

He basically shrugged it off and said that there's no point having psychosis about this.

That's precisely the point. Without quota-ing, companies will not have the incentive to push more people to work from home. Only with quota would they finally consider to do it from the lost productivity of all the people if they reach office at 2 pm.

Yes... after some thinking it does seem very impossible, perhaps increase the number of buses and such, more importantly those that can work from home should work from home. Perhaps bring back the buses used for train breakdowns to provide an alternative means?

All residents arriving in SG are slapped with a 14 day SHN

They are issued SHN for 14 days upon returning

Some are staying with their own house with their families while others are paying for serviced apartments or hotel to isolate themselves. 

Those staying with their families may have a higher chance of spreading to their loved ones if they are already infected since some HDB flats are really small and they share a common toilet for example.

But then again, the Chinese sprang into action (a little late) and someone from high up fired the mayor of Hubei for covering it up during party meetings.

Yes, but they take public transport home, or their families pick them up. Wouldn't this present the opportunity to spread the virus?

There’s a big difference. You’ve been told to isolate due to your travel, I assume if these people had also been told the same thing then they would be cooped up at home too.

Quick question- where did you fly back from? How were the airports? I’m in the US right now and before this whole thing blew up I booked my ticket back for early May. I’m considering coming back earlier but I’m afraid of leaving my home which is safe and exposing myself at the airports right now.

39 of 47 cases are imports.

If you divide the number of imported cases by the estimated number of overseas Singaporeans, you get an insanely high infection rate. Way higher than the infection rates based on official figures in Europe and the US.

=== Author: rdjedd===
One of the things that is a worrying stat is 35% of those are aged <25 years old.

NCID says 330-bed with capacity for expansion up to 500...but at 40+ a day no amount will be enough, they will definitely need alternative arrangements for less serious positive cases soon. I believe China built temporary ""ark"" hospitals to house such patients? If we cannot (or don't want to) emulate this then the less serious cases will probably be made to self-isolate.

=== Author: littlefiredragon===
Technically it's still single digit increment if we exclude those who got infected overseas and came back. I think looking at only local transmissions would show the current risk more accurately, because most ppl aren't going to be travelling elsewhere.

The number of imported cases is actually quite shocking, and makes me wonder if there are far more infected people overseas than tested and reported.

=== Author: xMrAngryPie===
If everything goes well, we gonna have double digit cases get discharge.

=== Author: InternalRide8===
The returning people may not have necessarily gotten the disease from foreign countries. It could be from airports, especially since so many infected people are passing through the airports every day

=== Author: taenerysdargaryen===
imported cases also include foreign arrivals, not just overseas Singaporeans.

No need wonder. Is a known fact for the under official report vs actual on ground overseas.

SG definitely also has unidentided case but hopefully the current system will pick up the case soon and the general advise of looking after personal hygiene and social distancing can reduce the spread.

=== Author: InternalRide8===
Some of the imported cases may have gotten it from the airport/airplane. As it stands, airplanes and airport are a breeding ground for the new disease, and nothing can be done about it because we can’t just shut the whole airport down (and we can’t test all passengers before they board the airplane either)

=== Author: atomic_rabbit===
A majority of the imported cases are Singaporeans.

=== Author: rdjedd===
Definitely is the case, and it's unfortunate they caught it.

I was commenting in general, these stats show that it's not just the elderly at most risk, everyone is. I say this because I still see and feel the young ones, hell even say <35 are still ignorant or just have this ""won't happen to me I never get sick"" attitude.

=== Author: swottttttt===
nah. young people know they could catch it. it's the ""even if I get sick I will recover fine"" attitude

=== Author: 557088===
> I say this because I still see and feel the young ones, hell even say <35 are still ignorant or just have this ""won't happen to me I never get sick"" attitude.

I think what they mean is they are less likely to go into critical condition, which is true. Everyone is likely to get infected but young people don't worry as much because it'll most likely be a mild case.

=== Author: littlefiredragon===
While everyone is at risk, the stats also confirms that the younger ones are at significantly lower risk as well. Compounding it with far lower rates of death and that young people have less pre-existing medical issues, the sentiment is quite justified.

=== Author: Spaiduhz===
Just because them youths are much more likely to recover doesn't mean they won't be carriers. Imagine sleeping off a fever one night and in the morning they see their parents being conveyed to the hospital suffering from respiratory complications.

Just because they are at lower risk doesn't mean they aren't being selfish and stupid.

pingmr,PSA please support your favourite businesses,29,forqni,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/forqni/psa_please_support_your_favourite_businesses/,40,1585177307.0,"Needless to say, the next month is going to be a terrifying time for local businesses and people working in affected industries. A lot of F&B and entertainment venues already have to deal with thin margins on the best of times. Now they are lucky to have 1/2 capacity due to social distancing measures, that is if they aren't simply forced to shut down altogether.

Please get in touch with the businesses you frequent and ask them if they need help. Some initiatives that I've seen happening are

1) buying additional packages for gyms (that you can use later). For example, I just bought ten additional passes from my gym.


2) buying gift cards or coupons from restaurants. Chope is rolling out a campaign that lets you get gift cards for restaurants - https://chopeandsave.com/. You can also read a longer article about supporting local f&b here https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/food-drink/drinks/small-businesses-restaurants-bars-covid-19-closures/?fbclid=IwAR2IWNWmYmRj0T_bnXLChQ2X0VJvCR5PhDGnOAMkLKF5sOgY0HLpbqzBxmo.


3) buying tickets for future screenings (the projector is selling packs of ten tickets that you can use in the future when they reopen - I'm going to get this too. See https://theprojector.sg/gifts)


4) if you're on a subscription and can afford to just let the subscription keep going, do that


5) order from restaurants that deliver. You help the restaurant serve more guests and also help the delivery driver.


All the above will give the businesses much needed cash flow that they can use to ride out the month of April. So that they will still be around in May. The great thing about coupons and gift cards is also that you don't even need to show up, so you can stay at home while giving your support.

Hopefully the stimulus package tomorrow is going to offer some relief, but really, if you ever said that we should support Singaporean businesses more, well now's the time to put your money behind your convictions.",2020-03-26 07:01:47,"

People are losing jobs left and right. How can you expect people to buy random things just to support local businesses. If you do have disposable income, please donate to healthcare workers to show appreciation, not to really financially support them.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
OP doesn't understand margins for retail businesses, specifically F&B are extremely slim. It can be as low as 3-5%. If you have 1000 dollars allocated for ""doing good"", you should find a charity that will directly benefit the maximum portion of the 1000 dollars. Not give it to a business owner who will eventually just pay CapitaLand.

Nope, landlords won't permanently reduce rental because of something that will go away in less than a year. At best they'll reduce rental temporarily until the outbreak is over.

I hate to be *that* guy, but in the economy as it is, the more people who think like this, the more likely the companies close down.

I understand the fear, but i also believe that if you actually have the means to (and can take that risk) then just go with the purchase!

But, only what you’re comfortable too la. No need all out buy everything, hoarding or otherwise. (:

Stay safe and support local! 
We’ll get through this.

=== Author: Arcturion===
I'm taking that risk to support companies that I hope will survive. It's not that different from buying 4D, except that the odds are better (the more you pump in, the more likely it is the business will carry on) and the payout is non financial (you dont win big money, but get to enjoy the service that you like).

It's a gamble, but for me one worth making. And like all gambles, everyone decides what they are comfortable with.

=== Author: pingmr===
Well yea, I'm buying all this knowing that there's a chance the company is going to die.

Spend what you can. Even if it's a small amount, these guys really appreciate it. You don't even need to believe me on this one - go talk to a business owner you know.

=== Author: pingmr===
People are going to be losing jobs left right up down and centre if all the affected businesses have to let their workers go and close shop. 

I don't expect people to buy anything, I'm only showing you how you can help people keep their jobs. If you're struggling yourself then obviously you don't need me to tell you to take care of yourself first.

Our healthcare workers and the hospitals have the full force of government financing behind them. Our restaurants don't.

Ahhh...the paradox of saving

=== Author: flippingnoob===
I get where you’re coming from. I really do. But you are trying to fight a burning building with a toy water gun. 

Retail brick and mortar businesses have extremely thin margins. Slightly increasing revenue will not help. The issue is the expenses, specifically the retail leases. They are notoriously high in singapore. Gyms take up a lot of space in prime real estate. A few hundred people pre-buying a few months of membership is not gonna help.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
And your recommendation is to increase revenue :)

=== Author: aiyopa===
Yup OP has no idea what he/she is talking about.

=== Author: pingmr===
Nah, I don't think you get it. If it's your house that is on fire, I think you'd still fight the fire with a water gun. For that matter your idea of donating to hospitals and healthcare staff both of which are all well funded, is like squirting a water gun into the ocean.

Of course rent is the main expense. But we aren't talking about slightly increasing revenue - some places might not be getting any revenue at all. It is now a question of getting whatever revenue they can.

A few hundred people buying a few months if membership is close to one month's rent. The Projector for example has said that their operating cost is about 10k a month. If 300 people bought their 60 dollar membership - I'll let you do the math.

=== Author: pingmr===
These are intiatives being set up by by the business owners themselves. I don't really care if you think I know what I'm talking about - you might want to listen to the people whose livelihoods are actually affected though, pretty sure they have some idea about what's going on.

=== Author: shadowfeenux===
Love your analogy and agree with you, but I think for the projector’s case might need to add another zero behind the figure

=== Author: flippingnoob===
Operating costs for The Projector is more like 100k a month, not 10k. Learn to read and I’ll let you do the math ;)

Are you privileged? Like top 1% privileged? My point is that if you have disposable income and and financially independent, you should go to your friends and family first, then to a legitimate charity, then whatever maybe to lower paid healthcare workers like nurses since they are risking their lives to help people get better

This isn’t gonna go away in a month or two. Nothing is going to change until a vaccine or herd immunity is developed. Your post recommending random redditors to dump money into random businesses wreaks of ignorance and entitlement. 

The businesses you recommend people dump their money into are at the end of the day businesses. Their goal is to make money. The few dollars of extra revenue you give them will be going straight to their rent, which is owned by the top 1% and also the Singapore government. Do you think Capitaland is going to evict all their tenants in 2-3 months? This isn’t just affecting one business, it’s all of them. 

Business owners are already fucked. They need to be bailed out by a larger entity. If you have extra money, you should save it or donate it to charity because covid 19 will be a part of your life for the next year or two. You may not be economically impacted now but you might be in the future

=== Author: flippingnoob===
“Please give us money because we are drowning in expenses” is exactly what anyone in that predicament will say. Problem right now is that a large majority of people are struggling financially. The demand is simply not there and the more people attempt to artificially inflate it will just hurt themselves.

=== Author: pingmr===
O you are right I read their fb post wrongly.

=== Author: pingmr===
You can quote the part of my OP that says ""support businesses to the exclusion of your friends and family/charities"", because I definitely did not say that. Our healthcare workers need our support yes, but they already are directly receiving government funding including additional bonuses.

Exactly, this isn't going away in a month or two, and this is when you go support the business that matter to you (you can also quote the part of my OP that says ""dump money into random business"", because I definitely did not say that).

And, goodness, I shouldn't need to clarify that you need to ""support with your means, take care of your own needs first"". That's basic common sense that I shouldn't need to spoon feed you.

The Government is announcing a package tonight but let's be realistic here the Government is not going to bail out small restaurants. At most it will bail out entities like Singapore Airlines, but there's not going to be direct bail outs of smaller businesses. These smaller businesses keep people hired - the money you give them goes to rent, but also wages and keeping people employed.

Entities that are closed down due to the restrictions are drawing 0 revenue. Any amount that you contribute directly goes towards reducing their losses. Obviously, it is more likely than not that things like coupons and pre-payments are not going to help these entities break even. But the goal here is not even about breaking even it's just about mitigating losses as far as possible. 

So. You can sit there and declare that ""someone should bail these businesses out"", and then do a surprised pikachu when these businesses all close down because the Government bail out is not there or not sufficient. Or you can do something about it and support the businesses that matter to you - and just for you, since you find this necessary, please don't spend beyond your means.

Simply saying ""well wait for a bigger entity to bail you out, I'm not going to do anything"" is the height of privilege, because that's a luxury that these businesses cannot wait for.

=== Author: pingmr===
""*And, goodness, I shouldn't need to clarify that you need to ""support with your means, take care of your own needs first"". That's basic common sense that I shouldn't need to spoon feed you*. ""

Plus the demand analysis is wrong. The demand for services is low due to various factors and not merely people struggling financially. Social distancing measures and closures aren't the product of people struggling financially.

Are you the top 1%? I mentor a lot of kids in middle class families and everyone is struggling. Even people with corporate jobs have their jobs at risk. Have you seen the price of oil lately? So many high paying oil jobs are at risk in Singapore. Won’t be surprised if there are already layoffs. 

Like I said, I get where you are coming from. You want to support small businesses, but no one should have disposable income to do what you suggest unless you are the top 1%. You are giving terrible financial advice during difficult times. 

Let’s see what you recommended. 

Leave a recurring subscription to grab food. Are you kidding? That whole entity is propped up by VCs. You are recommending people to leave a subscription on if they can afford it. No one can afford paying for something just to not lose it unless you are the top 1%. Even if they can, that’s a terrible method to support “small and local businesses”

Buy up 10 months of gym membership? Gym memberships are expensive in Singapore. It’s like 100 dollars a month, so you are recommending Redditors to prepay 1k to support a local business. Your advice is toxic.

Please, stop arguing with whatever fictional position you think I am holding. I've been very clear, and I'll clarify (again) that people should support businesses within their means. You seem to be under some misunderstanding that I'm asking kids in middle class families who are struggling to buy gym memberships, and that's just ridiculous.

>Are you the top 1%? I mentor a lot of kids in middle class families and everyone is struggling. Even people with corporate jobs have their jobs at risk. Have you seen the price of oil lately? So many high paying oil jobs are at risk in Singapore. Won’t be surprised if there are already layoffs.

=== Author: pingmr===
1) Our respective economic positions is irrelevant because I've repeatedly clarified that everyone should spend within their means. If you are from the 1% then by all means you can buy up a restaurant or two. If you aren't, please don't do it, and do something within your means. 

2) Exactly so your 50 affected persons can... choose to take care of their needs first? That's, literally what I am saying. 

3) Your example does not respond to the point I am making about your demand analysis. Yes everyone is facing financial issues, but this is not the sole reason for demand being what it is.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
Your audience in this post is Reddit right? And I’m saying unless you are in the top 1%, you should not spend more than typical just to “help out small businesses”. Don’t go buy ten months of a gym membership as that’s terrible financial advice especially during these times. You don’t need to explain what revenue is because unlike you, I am a successful business owner and I know how to analyze a financial statement. If I had a bunch of kids go up to me and buy a bunch of movie tickets or gym memberships, I would TURN IT DOWN because they will need it in the long run, unless the kid is from the top 1% and for some reason my business has some sentimental value to them.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
I wasn’t aware that majority of Reddit is in the top 1%. In your post you clearly said leave on whatever recurring plan if you can afford it. What comes to mind is a grab or food panda subscription. So since you bought 10 months of a gym membership and you used it as an example, I’m gonna assume you’re some privileged kid that had not worked a day in his/her life that can just do that that has no idea that money is scarce. It’s very rare to have extra to follow your terrible advice.

>Your audience in this post is Reddit right? And I’m saying unless you are in the top 1%, you should not spend more than typical just to “help out small businesses”. 

I've liberally clarified that people should spend what they can afford. 

> Don’t go buy ten months of a gym membership as that’s terrible financial advice especially during these times. 

Yeah I don't ask anyone to buy ten months of gym membership

> You don’t need to explain what revenue is because unlike you, I am a successful business owner and I know how to analyze a financial statement 

I hope you read financial statements better than my reddit posts, because your comprehension of what I have been saying so far has been selective. You have repeatedly, simply for the purposes of continuing your faux outrage, overlooked the fact that I am asking people to spend within their means.

=== Author: pingmr===
>\> In your post you clearly said leave on whatever recurring plan **if you can afford it.**

Can you explain your understanding of the bolded words? Because I think we are at an impasse, if you are just going to ignore this pretty important qualification to what I am saying.

>\> What comes to mind is a grab or food panda subscription. 

Great so thanks for clarifying that this grab food subscription is entirely from yourself, in which case you can also have a detailed discussion with yourself about the ills of subscribing to grad food due to it being propped up by VCs. I don't actually care about this because this isn't a particular point I am making. 

>\>   So since you bought 10 months of a gym membership and you used it as an example,

I don't. Stop making stuff up. This is what I said  "" *For example, I just bought* ***ten additional passes*** *from my gym.* "" I hope I don't need to also explain to you that passes and ""months"" are difference words.

>\>    I’m gonna assume you’re some privileged kid that had not worked a day in his/her life that can just do that that has no idea that money is scarce.

It is precisely because money is scarce that I am making this post. If I thought money grew on trees I wouldn't be worried about any business closing down or people losing jobs.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
I think I need to spell it out for you like a child as you have some severe reading comprehension skills and sound like a Singaporean Greta Thunberg. You constantly emphasize that you said ""If YoU CaN AfFoRd It"". 

Now l am asking you, **who are the groups of people that can actually afford your recommendations** that are not part of the top 1%. Even when times are not tough, it is generally recommended to avoid unnecessary spending, and here you are promoting random redditors in the middle of a disease outbreak to spend excessively just for the sake of helping small businesses. This is irresponsible advice hidden under the guise of charity. 

That is why I'm asking you about your financial background because you actually put your advice into action. **What is your current situation that allows you to prebuy 10 months of gym passes, leave recurring unused subscriptions, and buying random giftcards from restaurants?** Because people like you should be your audiences, not reddit. You might cause some secondary or university kid to go out and start spending random amounts of money that he/she does not have for the sake of helping their favorite businesses. 

If you recommended changing behavior that does not result in unnecessary additional spending I would agree. 
Like eat at local mom and pop stores and not McDonalds. But don't recommend people to load up on movie tickets, gym passes and gift cards to save the economy. That is just irresponsible. ""If YoU CaN AfFoRd It""

=== Author: pingmr===
Actually I think I am the one that needs to spell things out like a child because your selective reading is either sheer stupidity or petulance:

-  ""What is your current situation that allows you to prebuy 10 months of gym passes"" - Amazingly you have gone from ""10 months of gym subscription, to 10 months of gym passes, when what I actually said, and literally highlight to you, is ""10 gym passes"". 

- ""leave recurring unused subscriptions, and buying random giftcards from restaurants"" - I have only stated I will bought 10 gym passes, so again I'm not sure why you think I have done all this either. 

Now, as for the issue of ""if you can afford it"", you have asked "" who are the groups of people that can actually afford your recommendations that are not part of the top 1%"". Well the obvious answer is that the affordability of any of these options is for the reader to decide. I don't know or presume to know the financial conditions of people reading the post, which is why i say ""if YOU can afford it"". It doesn't matter what socio-economic group you are in - only you (the reader) are in the best position to decide if you can afford something. 

None of my suggestions is specific to any particular social economic group. You are the one artificially introducing this idea of the 1%. 

This subreddit has a fairly varied demographic, and is not ready only by students. After all, here you are as a ""successful business owner"". So the idea that the OP will only be seen by students is baseless.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
I don't know why you're so caught up on the wording of gym passes? You did buy 10 gym passes did you not? Most gym passes are for at least a month are they not? Some even lock you in for a year or two years. I just assumed you're not stupid enough to buy 10 1 year memberships. Maybe I shouldn't have given you the benefit of the doubt. Even if each pass is 30 dollars, that's still 300 dollars of unnecessary expenses. Most Singaporeans do not have that much disposable income to just throw out the window for the sake of helping small businesses. 

Okay so you only bought 10 gym passes. What is your own socio economic situation that made you decide that you have no other obligations in life but to purchase these 10 other passes? And does it apply to a majority of Singaporeans or specifically this subreddit?

I assumed you are giving advice based on actions that YOU YOURSELF TOOK. Guess not and you're just blowing hot air. 

I'm saying no one should follow your suggestions unless they are the 1% (could be an overstatement). I am introducing an audience because I live in reality and a vast majority of redditors do not have the disposable income to do as you suggested. You refuse to pinpoint an audience that should do as you suggested and you constantly dodge the question about your own socioeconomic status. 

How about you stop dodging my questions and stop nitpicking on minutia that does not help your argument?

Gym passes are a one time pass for a session at a particular gym. You are passing it off as though I bought a ten month membership.

I take particularity issue because it is disingenuous for you to skim my posts and then just pick a fight with whatever strawmen you have set up if your head. Engaging in good faith, with what *I am actually saying.*

>Okay so you only bought 10 gym passes. What is your own socio economic situation that made you decide **that you have no other obligations in life but to purchase these 10 other passes**? And does it apply to a majority of Singaporeans or specifically this subreddit?

I never made this decision? Again stop making stuff up. I have other financial commitments, but I felt that I could spare the amount need to buy 10 passes.

>I assumed you are giving advice based on actions that YOU YOURSELF TOOK. Guess not and you're just blowing hot air.

Yeah you assumed wrongly because you aren't spending the time to actually read before responding. My OP is clear. I said that here are ""some initiatives that I've seen happening"", listed the initiatives, and specially stated which ones I would be doing myself. Your lazy reading assumed that I was doing everything on the list because you did not read.

>I'm saying no one should follow your suggestions unless they are the 1% (could be an overstatement). I am introducing an audience because I live in reality and a vast majority of redditors do not have the disposable income to do as you suggested. You refuse to pinpoint an audience that should do as you suggested and you constantly dodge the question about your own socioeconomic status.

If people cannot afford the suggestions, then don't. How difficult is this for you to understand? You are the one assume the financial condition of the average redditor. On the other hand I have pitched my audience to be as wide as possible by literally saying ""do what you are able to"".

This is why my financial position is irrelevant - if I'm part of the 1% or if I'm poor, my message does not change at all. It is still going to be support your favorite businesses, to the extent that you can. **My financial position is irrelevant because it has no bearing on the message I am making. IN CASE YOU CAN""T READ THIS - MY MESSAGE DOES NOT CHANGE WHETHER I AM PART OF THE 1% OR NOT.** 

Look, if you think these options are too expensive for you, then my advice to you, repeated, is that please go tend to your more important financial commitments first. You don't need to come here and project whatever issues you have against gyms, restaurants, or the 1%. Just keep the money and take care of your immediate needs - this post is not for you. Alternatively, if you have a local businesses in mind that is more affordable and within a price range that you can afford, please go support them! My list is not meant to be exhaustive.

=== Author: flippingnoob===
Dude you bought the 10 gym passes. That means you already fulfilled your other financial obligations so you made the decision to buy the 10 gym passes. So you did make that decision. You are hilarious. I'm gonna stop responding because this is going nowhere. Continue to buy your 10 gym passes each month for the next year or so and remember to leave all your reoccurring unused expenses. You are a classic example of why schools should teach personal finance. Your options are not expensive. It is just bad advice. If you want to help people, donate to a charity. Pre-buying gym passes is not the way to go.

=== Author: pingmr===
Lol I thought you were a successful business owner who can read financial statements? I'm sorry to have to explain to you then that financial obligations aren't something that just happen and are done. They are ongoing obligations that you have to meet now and in the future. Not sure what kind of business you run but maybe you have heard of this thing called a mortgage as an example of an ongoing financial obligation? If you haven't I'm more than happy to explain - you see it is a form of security that the bank takes against a loan, and you have to pay back the bank on an ongoing basis. I hope that is simple enough for you.

I made the assessment that in addition to my existing obligations I am able to afford the passes (which in any event was well below your price of $300).

&#x200B;

>You are a classic example of why schools should teach personal finance.

Ah the irony. It is ***rich***.

>Your options are not expensive. It is just bad advice. If you want to help people, donate to a charity.

Charities, and consuming services, play different roles in the economy. They aren't inter-changeable in the way you are suggesting.

Consuming services directly helps service providers and the people they higher. Yes, some of this will go towards paying for their cost (rent).

Charity goes to specific causes (like animals) that ordinarily aren't able to be financially independent on their own. There is no ""charity"" for failed businesses, and so donating to a charity is not going to help your local business.

_""The Ministry of Health in Singapore identified two people from Singapore (C3 and C4), with no recent travel history to China, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from enhanced pneumonia surveillance. Activity mapping showed that both individuals had visited the same church on Jan 19, 2020. C5 was identified through active case-finding. **Two other people with COVID-19 were subsequently linked to this cluster (C1 and C2, who are husband and wife)**. These individuals were Chinese nationals from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on Jan 19, 2020. **Re-interviews with C1 and C2 found they had also visited the church on the same day**. All five people were asymptomatic during the church visit (figure 1 lower panels)._  
  
_The church is an independent church that occasionally receives a few visitors from China at the Mandarin service conducted every Sunday.11 Although C1 and C2 were not church members, they attended the 2-h morning service when they travelled to Singapore. They left immediately after the service and did not report having lunch at the church. Based on closed-circuit camera findings, **C5 occupied the same seat as did cases C1 and C2 at the prayer meeting after the morning service, but they did not recall meeting each other**.""_  
  
Question: No punishments for the ones who claimed they only stayed at home while asymptomatic, but was later found to have been the cause of a new cluster's formation?  
  
Edit: Cases 8 & 9.

=== Author: musr===
> Interpretation
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions. Enhanced surveillance and contact tracing is essential to minimise the risk of widespread transmission in the community.

Interpretation of their interpretation (after few hours of sleep), combined with the collective thought consciousness, and possibly my personal biases laced with flawed logic:

If one wants to contain and minimise the risk of widespread community transmission via contact tracing as opposed to more stringent measures such as public activity lock down all the way until quarantining everyone in their houses, the former being gentler on the economy, then current methods of contact tracing that utilise interviewing an infected person is insufficient for a variety of reasons such as weak memory, memory loss, bad memory, corrupted memory, unwillingness to divulge embarrassing or compromising details etc., and many potentially infected contacts cannot be traced in a timely manner, if at all.

Additional methods which could help include using the TraceTogether app, activating Google Maps timeline and/or journaling your movement activity.

=== Author: kanteater===
No it's not. It's Cases 8 and 9. They fell sick, went for testing, found out to have it, didn't report they went elsewhere, then Life Church ""started"" from Case 31 onwards, then it was found out actually Cases 8 and 9 went to Life Church, but by then Life Church Cluster passed on to the CNY gathering and the other church.

Case 8 and 9 are the different cases. 8 and 9 arrived in sg on jan 19. They're both also 56 years old 

The couple charged are 38 and 36 years old and arrived on jan 22

Its right in cna infographic

=== Author: kanteater===
I'm not talking about the couple already charged. I'm talking about why Cases 8 and 9 are not charged for not being truthful prior to hospital admission. No confusions here.

=== Author: evilplushie===
Apparently no evidence they lied intentionally maybe. Even contact tracer said people don't remember everything they did

That and i doubt they're still in sg

=== Author: kanteater===
Ugh ok, I can't argue with that. Just saying, it's very audacious to claim you've stayed home all these while, without going out _at all_ (!), when obviously you did.. and not only you did, you also infected others.  
  
Edit: Next question, should there be punishment for not remembering everything then? It's your social responsibility to not only minimise your tracks, but remember it even as you go gallivanting around town? Culpable for negligence.

=== Author: kanteater===
That's a big assumption to make. My mom, a sufficiently older person who is part of pioneer generation, hasn't left the house ever since last day of CNY ended, except 4-5 times out to buy lunch just 2 mins away, and have been refusing visitors to her place.  
   
And prior to the virus and TraceTogether, I've used her phone to enable permanent sharing of her geolocation with my phone as she has expressed concerns before about early symptoms of dementia.     
  
I'm just saying... Older people can be responsible too. We also have a part to play to educate the older people in our families. And this should be another matter all together because negligence is still negligence.

=== Author: sneakpeek_bot===
> # MUIS: All mosques to remain closed until ‘situation improves’

> As part of Covid-19 containment efforts, the closure of all mosques in Singapore will now continue until further notice.

> In addition, the congregational Friday prayers will also remain suspended until further notice, or “until the situation improves”.

> These new measures were announced by the Islamic Religious Council (MUIS) at a press conference on Tuesday (Mar. 24).

> Singapore’s Mufti, Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, stated that the decisions were made unanimously by the Fatwa Committee, a group of senior religious leaders.

> He added:

> “When the early decision to close the mosques (was made), there were only about less than 200 cases. And based on the earlier 14-day closure, the mosques were supposed to be opened this Friday (Mar. 26). But the cases are now at 509, with two deaths. Obviously, for the Fatwa committee, it is not right for us to open the mosques.”

> Timeline

> The first announcement of the closure of mosque was announced on Mar. 12.

> All mosques were to close for five days starting Mar. 13.

> As of Mar. 13, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore was 200.

> However, on Mar. 16, Muis announced that it will extend the five-day period closure.

> The total number of cases in Singapore was 243 as of then.

> But earlier today (Mar. 24), Muis announced that all mosques in Singapore will remain closed until the situation improves.

> Singapore saw a total of 509 Covid-19 cases as of 5pm on Mar. 24.

> Small spaces available for individual prayers in 19 mosques

> As the mosques continue to remain closed, Muis, however, has opened up small spaces in 19 mosques across Singapore for individual prayers to be done.

> This move is mainly targeted to working Muslims, such as taxi and private hire drivers, who may not be able to find an appropriate space to conduct their prayers.

> Muis added that these spaces also allow the mosques to build up their precautionary capabilities in preparation for eventual reopening.

> It also encourages the community to practice the new norms of safe distancing, reduced duration, bringing their own prayer items and not shaking hands.

> No issue missing three consecutive Friday prayers

> On the issue of congregational prayers, including Friday prayers, the Fatwa Committee observed that Muslim law recognises both illness and fear for one’s safety as valid reasons not to hold or attend such prayers.

> There is also no issue of missing three consecutive Friday prayers, as it is not obligatory under these circumstances.

> The Committee also noted that under these circumstances, with the risk of infection still on the rise, it is the “responsibility of every Muslim to help keep everyone safe”.

> Additional support for Singapore’s Muslim community

> While mosques remain closed, MUIS said that essential services will still be provided to Singapore’s Muslim community via alternative means.

> More mosque programmes and talks will be made available through online platforms.

> The list of online programmes available in the next 2 weeks is available here.

> The weekly aLIVE classes will continue to be suspended and mosques will shift to online and home based learning mode for the duration of the mosque closure.

> Resources for parents and students are available on this website.

> As mosques play an important role in supporting low-income house, who are recipients of zakat assistance, mosques will continue to support these families during the closure period.

> Social development officers and the network of mosque befrienders will continue to reach out to families on long-term zakat financial assistance.

> Zakat financial assistance will remain available at the 31 Social Development Mosques.

> Necessary measures are also put in place to protect the health and safety of both clients and staff of the mosques.

> “Muis thanks the community for its unwavering support in these challenging times, and prays for the continued safety and wellbeing of the community and the nation.”

Where should I start?,0,fp5k9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fp5k9e/looking_at_moving_to_singapore_from_australia/,10,1585227389.0,"I’m not convinced there will be many opportunities left for someone like me after the COVID-19 pandemic ends in Australia, and I’m looking at moving to another English-speaking country in search of new opportunities.

I’m currently studying Law and International Relations and Political Science in Australia, and am thinking about working in social/market research in Singapore after finishing university. I was doing something very similar for a couple of years in Australia before I got stood down indefinitely due to social distancing guidelines.

I also find many, but not all Australians difficult to work with. Oftentimes, they are lazy, slow-thinking, disorganised and have a hard time thinking outside the box. It would be nice to work with a more disciplined and productive workforce, if Singapore offers that.

I understand that an Australian law degree would be acceptable in Singapore since it’s a common law country, though I don’t want to practise law and was looking at using my law degree to get into other social sciences work. Once I return to work in Australia, I am thinking of saving money to leave the country for after I graduate from university.

Broadly, I just feel like Australia is like a sleepy country town where nothing interesting happens quickly enough. Australians seem to be fairly apathetic to economic and social progress, even when it clearly benefits them.

Can you help me out, r/singapore?",2020-03-26 20:56:29,"

You came to the wrong place to ask for advice tbh. The age range of people on r/singapore skews pretty young. Which means they're generally unqualified to give advice on job related matters, although that won't stop them from doing it. And they also mostly dislike Singapore. They all want to move to Australia/Western countries. 

Having spent time in Australia I can sort of understand where you're coming from. My two cents is that the grass isn't always greener. Personally I prefer living in Singapore, but I'm also of the opinion that if you're miserable where you are, you'll be miserable if you move as well. Don't expect people here to be radically different than in Australia. People are people, wherever they're from.

this is the apathy capital of the world, besides we’re under the same covid situation as australia right now so maybe give it some time

=== Author: FruitCrisps===
Just a reality check: are you an Australia citizen? Know that in many countries, especially during trying times like this, locals will be prioritised (or at least an effort will be made for the public to perceive so) when it comes to employment, healthcare, etc. 

I work in an international organisation and many non-local colleagues have shared that it’s difficult to move jobs because they’re not citizens or PR. This is one factor to consider. 

A lot of legitimate points raised by others here as well. Sooner or later you may feel suffocated by the workaholic or face time culture here. Grass always looks greener on the other side and many locals do wish for a more laid back workplace culture like what we hear of in Australia too.

=== Author: I_love_pillows===
Singaporeans are very and too workaholic and some people have social expectations to stay beyond the office hours.  Not sure about law work culture. Personally I love Australians’ principles of work life balance and i like to take that culture any time.

=== Author: EpicVictoryRoyale999===
You have about half as many recorded COVID-19 cases as we do. I don’t know what’s happening in Singapore right now regarding employment but heaps of casual workers either got laid off or stood down in Australia. Now, we have heaps of people trying to get social security payments, with no idea if or when they will return to their jobs. Shutting down the county doesn’t seem to be helping contain the virus’ spread at this point.

I would prefer not to wait around for the country to get its act together again; I like to make things happen . If the Australian economic situation improves, I will consider staying but there is no sign of that at the moment. That’s why I’m considering leaving.

=== Author: EpicVictoryRoyale999===
Work-life balance is a farce, in my opinion. I already have workaholic tendencies, and I already have to stay beyond office hours at one of my jobs (it was intended as a side gig with my main job, from which I got most of my income). 

I can’t say Australian work culture is anything to admire. Where I live, almost everything is closed before 9AM and after 5PM, and there are too many public holidays. It’s very frustrating for someone who gets up early and sometimes comes home late (I have various volunteer roles which I took up to aid my professional development). Quite a few people where I live don’t want to be part of a 24/7 city partially because ‘muh family time’ or because they think the smaller businesses, who oftentimes don’t open as much as their competitors, will lose money. The most annoying part is that they have this mentality and wonder why they’re poorer than other parts of the country.

From what you’re telling me, Singapore sounds like an ideal place for me to work in.

=== Author: I_love_pillows===
I lived in a small city Australia for few years. It does feel like a ghost town on weekends.  

Yea in Singapore shops will open til 9 or 10pm, and after that a second rush hour begins for the retail staff.

Some singaporeans and the national government culture is geared towards pragmatism and ‘key performance indicators’ where an organisation / person is expected to fulfil. Sometimes it can feel so soulless where some factors are frequently benchmarked to money

While I may not agree with all government policies I feel that other countries could adopt our ways to fight COVID19

I know that it may not be feasible in larger countries but these methods could be enforced by local state governments instead of the federal level, kind of like acting as a small country by itself

Somethings that make me feel safe enough to go about my daily activities with not much concerns even though we may have a higher percentage of cases than other countries

Active testing instead of passive testing. We don't go to test for COVID19 by ourselves when we feel sick. We will be approached by authorities or referred to the NCID by general practitioners.

Aggressively seek out suspected cases and test them, don't wait for them to come to you

>
Aggressive contact tracing, we have a ""task force ish* team of contact tracers that go and actively find those that have been in close contact with a cluster or case

>
Politicians that don't screw around, even when we had our first few cases, we were prepared before hand to handle such an epidemic with politicians who all take a firm stance be it from the ruling or opposition parties

nlim2004,"Honest question: How far is locking down Singapore gonna be an effective barrier for lowering covid-19 cases in Singapore, considering the fact that most (≥50-70%) of cases are imported cases involving Singaporeans and PRs returning, either from study, work or non-essential travel?",50,fm9gq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fm9gq5/honest_question_how_far_is_locking_down_singapore/,83,1584794254.0,"Really curious. Please share your opinions.

As the title suggests, wouldn't lockdown be detrimental if

(a) Blocking (most) foreign flights, and if only one airline that is not singapore airlines, how are we going to be bringing locals back
(b) cause even more panic we've previously seen
(c) block out our food resources, considering if a lockdown is announced, hoarders will be at it again, and (even) Malaysia can't import food to us anymore",2020-03-21 20:37:34,"
=== Author: redwithin===
Nearly all the imported cases are returning citizens, PRs or long term residents. This is not the category you want to block off. The Stay Home Notice is sufficient to help prevent community transmission. 

The number of cases to watch for is not the total number, but the local number and particularly the number of unlinked cases. As those two numbers go up, more measures will be necessary.

=== Author: 300maan===
Thing is, how long can you lockdown?

After the lockdown is over, is the world free of COVID-19? If not, we will be re-importing cases.
 
That's why we are doing the next best thing by aggressively tracing people and making them stay home in a bid to not overwhelm our healthcare resources

=== Author: skatyboy===
When Wuhan was closed off, they still had supplies coming in, so it is a non-issue.

The problem is denying Singapore residents (especially Singapore citizens) from entering Singapore. No country will be stupid to ban its own citizens from coming back and so far, no country has said ""We are blocking off all incoming traffic, including our citizens"". Okay, then you don't prevent Singaporeans from coming back, but they are clearly at elevated risk of carrying COVID-19. Then how?

The government clearly can't shut off borders completely without breaking its constitutional duty to not hold back citizens from their own country (not a lawyer, but Article 13(1) of the constitution seems to support this idea), but in doing so, the border is no longer impermeable.

=== Author: 557088===
More importantly is for SHN to be obeyed. If those returning overseas don't interact with anyone besides their family, the spread is still mostly contained.

=== Author: ssaxamaphone===
Work from home needs to be mandated at this point. So many people I know, including myself, can work from home but our employers are not allowing it

=== Author: blitzmango===
Lockdown is everyone quarantine, can't even go to out to the hawker ctr to eat or to the mini-mart to buy things. 

Closure of border is the likelier option. Means nobody entering, nobody going out. Food supplies may still come in. We can still go about our daily lives, even though it will cause the panic level to go up. 

a) the citizens can stay in the foreign country for the time being, especially if Singapore is not any better than where they are. 

b and c) yes it will cause even more panic, which will see an uglier side of SG.

But before announcing a lockdown, the country and government has to be prepared for it, the present and the future. Eg. how to ration food and supplies etc to the people.

=== Author: Gungalley===
In my opinion, a lockdown is a bandaid solution. If your number of cases get too dire and the system is on the brink of falling, and you need to stop the increase in number of cases ASAP, then lockdown. You can't lockdown forever. After you release your lockdown, you're still susceptible to another wave of infections as ppl start flying in from other infected countries.

So IMO, lockdown has its uses. Its not the answer to everything. It's just a temporary measure.

=== Author: Boogie_p0p===
wait, lockdown = shut borders or everyone quarantine? my idea of lockdown = shut borders.

=== Author: Zukiff===
Not going to be effective. The lock down in other nations is due to local spread. Ours is due to imported cases, so a lock down will have minimal effect. That's why we are currently having everyone inbound to SG to stay home. That will stop the import cases. The new social distance initiative is to ensure the local spread does not go up. We have so far ensure the curve is flat, hopefully we can keep it that way. All it takes is 1 unfortunate event.

=== Author: tenbre===
People keep jumping to lockdown because that's all they can think of. Whereas gov.sg has been quite creative in implementing partial targeted measures along the way, adapting to the cases, instead of a complete lockdown of people in their homes. Credit to the gov. 

Also it helps we mostly kept control from the start compared to countries which realized quite late.

=== Author: gametheorista===
You do a lockdown in parallel with high import periods, like now, as people stream home.

It cuts down transmission from imported cases and stops them from getting into the community, and it stops community spread.

=== Author: wiltedpop===
Everyone got different definition of lockdown, actually it’s a gradual scale, I consider even keeping GP, polyclinic, post offices, groceries, some skeleton bank functions open As a lockdown already.

&#x200B;

obviously it’s so bloody costly to lockdown, at least cost 100million per day of revenue/biz productivity lost. Actually they have to prepare us the population for the eventuality/possibility of a lockdown, so we don’t order too much inventory fnb, so we implement safeguards and plan b. I mean we just need one asymptomatic Super spreader to give 50++ church members in different industry jobs and we got a big problem

=== Author: blizstorm===
COVID is a very tricky pandemic to control. The infected can be asymptotic, can be infectious just after 1 day, and disguise itself as flu. 

Singapore border control is good, but far from perfect. What if a traveller, took aspirin to circumvent the thermal scanner? What if the PCR test give a false negative? What if there are someone who disobeyed the stay at home notice? What if Singapore has an entire family of asymptotic spreader?

You mentioned 70% of the cases are imported, so there are still 30% case that are local. There are 40+ cases which nobody know how they are getting infected. So internally, we are not clear of COVID, and might be just like korea on Feb 18.

Now is not the time to be complacent

=== Author: septeal===
That's why we're not right.

=== Author: woowombat===
We haven't even had a simple ban on flights from the UK, if you can believe that. Look at all the cases we've imported from there over the past few days. 

We're pretty far from a lockdown.

=== Author: Intentionallyabadger===
For a total lockdown, we’ll still admit citizens/PRs etc. This is what other countries are doing. Just work out how to send a plane there to get them home. Land already immediately test. 

Even though Malaysia is locked down, we still import food from them. You need special passes.

=== Author: xMrAngryPie===
Haha. That’s the reason why the govt keep telling everyone. We are currently not in the situation where total lockdown would help. There is still no sign fast pace community spreading.

=== Author: BreakWindow===
We should not consider the percentage of cases that are imported, but the number of   
local transmissions relative to our population.

=== Author: maolyx===
I think if ban flights, can ban people but still allow cargo so items won't be affected? 

But the things is even if we do take precautions, we will still be affected if other countries don't take precaution and fly here. I think lockdown will work best if all countries take the same stringent precautions but it is kind of hard and we can't lockdown forever.

=== Author: ComradeSg===
OP, i think you misunderstood what a lockdown means. It is not a siege or a blockade where there are no movement of goods and people.

Lockdown is aimed at breaking the virus transmission chain. You do that by reducing human to human contact by asking people to work from home, incoming citizens undergo 14 day isolation, restrict travel, prohibit social gathering and events, close down businesses that bring people into close proximity.

Lockdown allows all essential supplies and goods to carry on. It also allows essential staff to carry on functioning including the retail trade that is important - supermarkets etc. and most businesses to carry on. Just that staff are either working from home or no longer in close proximity.

Its more a change of lifestyle but in some cases there will be jobs losses because certain sectors will not be allowed to organise gathering etc and makes no sense to employ staff.

=== Author: bondbandito===
Yea we're testing a much higher proportion of incoming people, you can bet the actual cases amongst locals is far higher than the imported cases.

Singapore probably has enough reserve to shutdown international travel for 5 years.

But the target we all probably can look at is 1 year. 1 year later, vaccine should be somewhere near mass production. Those countries that are going for herd immunity, would have their herd immunity already.

It is against international law to refuse entry to your own citizens.  That’s why Europe is lan lan with the number of Isis idiots returning, and would rather they rot away in jail or are “accidentally” blown up in air strikes on the way home.

The thing is everybody thinks there will not be a major local spread until it is too late. See Italy and South Korea.

=== Author: wiltedpop===
but so many holes inside the SHN policy right now, people can still go and stock up on groceries for their supposed 14 day self quarantine. They can take pub transport, grab, queue at supermarket etc.

they should be forced to deposit 300 bucks with Fairprice online and just get groceries delivered to them for that 2 weeks. i mean seriously the outside world outside sg is absolutely infected at this point

If there's real lockdown (that you don't even allow to go out) then we'll see a new wave of complaint of what gov *should do* in the first place

=== Author: 123dream321===
They are desperate because they are looking at situation in US and EU. Think logically and you will see that sg is not in the same situation as them. They are in a far worst state as they cannot implement contact tracing and temperature scanning at airport because of their privacy concerns. Which sg had implemented way earlier on and we didn't downplay covid as just another flu which they did.

We can't spend our reserves like schoolchildren spend their pocket money - if that's what you're thinking when you say 5 years.

This kind of lockdown is tricky, giving freedom to people, people will still go about their daily lives like normal except working. 

TBH Non-essential businesses as a whole actually form a good portion of any economy and they support many of these essential businesses. Bear in mind non-essential businesses are usually SMEs, start ups etc. Closing them down will effectively kill them, unless the government helps, a lot. 

So even though it lessens the impact, it is a bigger drop compared to all companies running at half capacity across the board.

=== Author: jinhong91===
I'm ok with NY style lockdown.

=== Author: blitzmango===
Yup that's what I mention in the last part. Not so simple as just lockdown, good thing for us is, from the first case to now, we have time to prepare, not like Italy or Malaysia, either don't have or never check, then suddenly a huge spike everywhere, then no choice, damage control, got to lockdown before it goes out of control. 

It is like a machine or runner, want to slow down can, want to pick up speed also can. But if suddenly from full speed jam break, want to start again also take some time.

=== Author: Zukiff===
U are not wrong. We are 1 crazy woman or 1 unfortunate event from that happening. However since the local cases are small, again, it doesnt make that much sense for a full lockdown because we cannot lock down nearly as comprehensively or as long as what China is doing and since most of our case is imported, after the lockdown ends, we would still have imported cases. We can block them from coming in for a while but not for long

=== Author: blizstorm===
just 1 case, at malaysia tabligh, for 2 weeks, is enough to send a country to lockdown. there is at least 500 cases from that one

=== Author: woowombat===
Sure, but we don't even have something like Taiwan/AUS/NZ/Canada/India/Malaysia/etc have done. All non-citizens/PRs are travel banned. I think that is a prerequisite for a lockdown, and even that seems far-fetched here at this point.

What exactly is reserve for? A number to be grown to infinity? Or a fund used for crisis? This pandemic, is the equivalent of world war 3, and now is not the time to be stingy with money

We are can try to be stingy with money, take away lockdown measure like thailand has done . Thailand was openly welcoming China tourist back in Feburary, suppressing COVID test to maintain tourist confidence. Look at them now.

My estimate, that if containment fail, is that 500,000 Singapore residents will die. The loss from that will be more than Singapore can spend in a year then.

Their lock down model essentially promotes social distancing, discouraging gathering and social event. At some point we would need consider some sort of lock down model and we would need to pick our poison. I think it is general consensus that not everyone will be saved from the economic impact.

It is doable but not socially accepted in the west. That's the problem that they are facing. China had 1800 teams in one city to do contact tracing at one point

=== Author: Calikura===
>My estimate, that if containment fail, is that 500,000 Singapore residents will die.

How did you arrive at this estimate?

>A number to be grown to infinity? Or a fund used for crisis?

It is neither. One of the many implications of drawing down too heavily on the reserves, to simplify as much as possible, is that we will have less capital to conduct investment activities and consequently bring in less returns. Lots of things depend directly on these investment returns. You may not think some of these very important, however, there are things that directly concern you and I - for example, guaranteed CPF interest rates. How do you think it is possible to ""guarantee"" them through the good times **and** the bad?

We *are* spending what we need and are not stingy. Drawing down on Past Reserves is *not* out of the question. But what we aren't doing is being reckless. Now is not the time for a poorly calculated all-in.

ed: to add, ""reserves"" doesn't just refer to a bank account somewhere that contains 100% liquid asset (cash) that can be withdrawn and spent as and when we want. The MOF website has a good writeup on what the reserves actually are.

seems like my 500k was an underestimate IF containment fail.

With that number of people dead, do not be surprised if there is a breakdown in government, investors lost of confidence in Singapore, loss of social capital, massive bankruptcy of companies.

Strictly speaking, a government does not need capital reserve to conduct investment. US, with 20 trillion debt, is still capable of investing. Spending 100 billion from reserve will probably only cost 2 billion in Net Investment Returns Contribution. The dead people, their taxes, is easily more than these 2 billion. Singapore has been saving a lot of reserve. Every year, at least 10 billion from land sales, like 60% of the price you paid for HDB, goes to the reserves

CPF 2.5% interest rate, is guaranteed by 6% long term investment in equities. The extra returns from equities, earning 20% even in good times, while only paying 2.5% CPF interest rate, is used to covered the interest in bad times.

That said, I am not exactly advocating everyone to shut themselves at home now, but 100 billion would be enough to close off Singapore to international travel, but remain open for domestic economy, and to continue to trade goods and digital services.

The tracing app is one of their solution. So ask your friends to download them.

=== Author: blizstorm===
you know singapore population is 6 million right? if theres 2 million infected, pretty much the other 4 million would have been in contact with them, so by then, the entire nation is in qurantine already.

my guess is right now, the government only has capability for 1000 case. when the number exceed the contact tracing ability, the situation is considered as out of control and the best thing would be a national quarantine. 

If the government prepare, maybe can do 10,000 or even 50,000. At 10,000, you would be needing like 50,000 contract tracer... that is like the entire army dropping their training and doing contact tracing work; but these 50,000 need to be first taught on how it is done...

yep, it’s a given since i’m serving our motherland. However, from what I’ve heard, it’s quite useless on ios cause it can’t run in the background. Seeing how there’s a lot of apple users in sg, it’s not that reliable yet?

=== Author: isparavanje===
If all android users use it, it's already ⅔ penetration. It's not foolproof on its own, but:
a) lightens the contact tracers' workload, and
b) help to make up for gaps in memory.

If the virus has a R0 of, say, 3, then contact tracing must be able to find 67% of all potentially infected people for each new case for the virus to fizzle out (weighed by probability of infection, so it's more important to get the closest contacts first). It doesn't need to be 100%. Anything that gets us closer is helpful.

This is an update to an earlier post (data points can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v0T5GegnB0p8-qe5BrjpqxjpE6NATZSXoYsTjGBVEm4/edit#gid=342328679)). I've taken all your feedback into account when producing this version, so thanks for that!

\- Please **do not** crosspost this on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) due to the ongoing moratorium on COVID-19 posts.

\- The top graph refers to all active and recovered cases, the bottom graph only active cases.

\- I ordered the clusters based on their relation to each other. You may notice, for example, the GAOG cluster appearing before the Mei Hwan Dr cluster that technically happened before, but that is because the dates reflect a positive virus test. (and some cases were retrospectively tested)

\- Most of the clusters were grouped based on MOH's official statements. I plan to split up the imported cases by country of origin soon.

\- I made this chart to put the total number of cases in perspective: you can see which cluster is the most significant at a particular time.

=== Author: xinderw===
Good visualisation! The 1st chart suggests that the earlier identified clusters have became dormant, which is kind of reassuring. However the high number of imported cases has the opposite effect... would it be possible to further break them down by country? Or not possible as MOH does not share the info publicly.

=== Author: ivegivenuponnames===
Active cases looks like a deflated balloon

=== Author: isparavanje===
Just a suggestion, perhaps it could be a good idea to move imported to the top? That way we can get a visual representation of what the local transmission numbers look like.

=== Author: GrimaH===
Thank you; you're doing great work. This keeps the untraced case counts in perspective.

=== Author: vonstirlitz===

I think this information is available on MOH, and definitely would be good to have. Casually browsing, it looks like UK is our biggest virus importer.

=== Author: rueynshard===
Per-country information won't tell you much without knowing how many people have returned from that country in total.

Hi! I created a separate graph of all imported cases on the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v0T5GegnB0p8-qe5BrjpqxjpE6NATZSXoYsTjGBVEm4/edit#gid=878057680). It's quite messy because many cases travelled to more than one country, but yeah.

=== Author: xinderw===
Wow great effort there! Although it's quite messy due to the many countries but it puts things into perspective. I like how the legend is also sorted by the order from top-bottom as well. Only talking about visualisation here, maybe an improvement would be to have labels pointing to each area instead of the legend by its side for ease of reference (but no need to change for it's good as it is now!) Thanks for exploring the idea.

=== Author: SadKaleidoscope2===
Well I'm still trying to get around the functionality of google sheets! If anyone knows a platform to represent the data better do let me know :)

Edit: [Flourish Studio](https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/98793/) seems to be my solution: the colours are better, and you can hover over each area to see the labels.

I have no idea about specifics but most MPs make their rounds in the various markets and food centres or community centers within their ward on a weekly basis. Ministers less often due to event commitments. The more established opposition also do it almost every week except due to their manpower, they do rotations within the areas they want to contest so they appear even less often than the elected MPs despite them walking as often. 

Both groups are more visible during elections simply because they ramp up the activities during that time. There is no way they are able to sustain election level walkabout for long

Let's hope our hospitals and healthcare workers are able to handle these amount of cases each day and not become overwhelmed.

Majority are imported cases, so i think we should be seeing the bulk of those Singaporeans who are coming back to homeland. Hopefully these returnees have or will peak soon and we can go back down to our usual local cases. 

In other words, we are basically doing the hard work (treating the patients) that other countries can’t do.

=== Author: X1yWe4YQx59g===
We're now seeing the peak of cases from people who returned before the mandatory SHN rules kicked in last week.  This is the ""make or break"" week for the second wave in Singapore: if we can prevent local transmission from breaking out now, all future entrants will (should) be quarantined and unlikely to infect others.  Fingers crossed, and keep an eye on the ""local unlinked"" number, because that's the one that really matters right now.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore has confirmed 54 new Covid-19 cases, including 48 that are imported, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (March 23).

> This is the highest number of new cases Singapore recorded in a day so far.

> All except one of the imported cases were returning residents and Long Term pass Holders.

> On Monday, the Government announced that all travellers arriving in Singapore - including Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders - must submit an online health declaration before proceeding with immigration clearance

> The imported cases had travelled to Europe, North America and South-east Asia .

> The remaining six cases announced on Monday are currently not linked to travel or previous cases and contact tracing is ongoing.

> This brings the total number of infected patients here to 509, of which 15 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Eight more cases have been discharged, bringing the number of discharged and fully recovered cases to 152.

Dear fellow Singaporeans, I urge you to cancel your overseas holiday trips within next 3 months. No matter, how expensive is your holiday, it can't be more expensive than yours and the lives of your loved ones. Banning short term visitors and tourists into Singapore has been great. Potential consequences for long-term pass holders to leave Singapore is even better. But, Singaporeans not belonging to these categories, should self-discipline for own-selves and their loved ones.

At this point, it seems that countries have not taken enough precautions during the Jan/Feb period where the coronavirus was incubating in China. Looks like some of the infected patients from Asia managed to slip through the cracks enough to cause the outbreak. Harsh to say, but it may have been wise, in hindsight, to have just shut off all travel from Asia/China while it happened.

The conspiracy theorist in me says that, given how infection this disease is, there are still infected people in Asia that are causing all the hotspots around the globe. Look, if even one guy gets away untracked in a densely populated country like China/India, another hotspots could spring up pretty quickly.

UK finally going for the lockdown route, after exporting so many cases...

=== Author: annadpk===
According to the CDC officials in Wuhan who have spoken to reporters, off the record of course, they are getting about a few or dozen  asymptomatic cases every day in Wuhan. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-23/wuhan-still-finding-symptom-free-virus-cases-caixin-reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-23/wuhan-still-finding-symptom-free-virus-cases-caixin-reports)

In China they only report cases if the people test positive and shows symptoms. About a 1/3 of the cases people were tested positive but shown no symptoms. In Iceland it was 50%.

Singapore isn't testing everyone who has come into contact, only telling people to self--quarantine until they get symptoms.  If you don't have symptoms, its possible to spread it after you leave the 14 day quarantine.

If I were the government I would do a rapid test on everyone in Singapore.

Well. Obviously they are linked to something / someone. It’s just now the tracing process relies heavily on their “memory” - if they “forgot” something - then well - unlinked. 
Until they find another source and then those with short memory say “oh ya ya, i remember that”

=== Author: isparavanje===
Sometimes it takes a while to find links. The number of unlinked cases has not changed from yesterday to today, which means they managed to link 6 previouslyuunlinked cases.

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
But if you think about it, there were numerous unlinked cases reported in the previous days. They were all not related to each other. Can you imagine the number of unknown clusters out there ? We are at the point where we literally can’t contract trace the people that come in contact with the patients. This is going to be the major turning point and this is where we will slowly start to peak in local transmission cases.

The USA might not be so bad yet - high number of cases, but not that many deaths. 35000 cases but only 458 deaths suggests that at least they're getting on top of things, especially in New York. This is more in line with the numbers from South Korea and Germany (which has 26000 cases and 111 deaths)

The UK though is at 5600 cases and 281 deaths, which means that they're severely under-testing and are likely to follow the Italy trajectory.

Implications are that if you don’t know who are they linked with then you don’t know who else might be infected and might be infecting others. 
When they register a positive case - they also register his / her “close circle” those who potentially might have been infected - and then they call them few times a day to check if they have fever or symptoms.

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
It literally means that there is a substantial number of clusters now. 

From what I’ve read yesterday, we have 31 unlinked cases that are unsolved. If we take every two suspected cases to be from the same source, we would at least have 15-16 sources out there. If each of them are a cluster of their own or even if linked, the infection has already spread to way more people than we( the public) would have projected. Adding the asymptomatic and mild symptoms patients. This is just a probability based game now.

Download TraceTogether to reduce their workload for current and future tracing.

With the app, even if the infected person lies or can’t recall completely where/who he/she is in contact, the app can fill this gap.


scenario 1 - links between unlinked case A and previously detected case B can be established if both use the app, instead of going through travel history of case A and B. 

For each unlinked case, I am guessing they would need to try to match against every single known case (around 500+ at the moment)


scenario 2 - links between unlinked case A and unlinked case C can be established if both use the app, instead of going through travel history of case A and C

Thus, a new cluster can be discovered earlier.

And in both scenarios, the app can aid in finding a list of people who case A has come into contact with. The app also stores the hash of the phone number of these people, making it easier to contact/identity them.

Asymptomatic shedding of the virus probably isn’t so common according to this WHO doctor.

”There’s this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases. Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.
In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for influenza surveillance and other screening. Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province. (Covid-19 is the medical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.)
There is no evidence that we’re seeing only the tip of a grand iceberg, with nine-tenths of it made up of hidden zombies shedding virus. What we’re seeing is a pyramid: most of it is aboveground.
Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I’ll be saying, “Guess what? Those data didn’t tell us the story.” But the data we have now don’t support it.”

You can do a IgE test first (rapid) like they are doing in Spain and Italy. It has a 95% accuracy rate. Than if someone comes up positive than use PCR test.

Of course you prioritize certain people first.

The reality is SIngapore's infections rates since the first case have been growing 3-4% a day.. It doesn't seem like a lot, but over time it adds up.

The problem isn't the cost for Singapore.  It would cost US$ 2.5 Billion to have everyone tested in Singapore using a PCR test. The problem is testing capacity.  That is why Italy and Spain are using the rapid test to screen people

Source? Diagnosis of COVID-19 vs presentation of COVID-19 symptoms are different subjects. From my understanding, the actual diagnosis of COVID-19 is done using a sample from the patient (via different test kits for RT-PCR). A patient might show some of the symptoms of COVID-19 but that is not enough for the diagnosis of COVID-19. That is evidence for the doctors to prescribe testing for COVID-19, which requires physical samples to run.

Yeah, assisted-living arrangements aren't exactly uncommon in the UK. Easily tens of thousands of people live in those and in nursing homes. There's a nursing home in the US that has already lost half of its residents to the virus and counting. It's a nightmare scenario.

=== Author: Akabander===
American checking in here... Love your optimism, but our for-profit healthcare system leaves no margins for unexpected increases in demand. When the cases get serious our hospital system is going to be overwhelmed quite quickly, I expect. What's worse, our late-stage capitalist economy has made hospitals into competitors, so they are already not inclined or able to share resources or even data between institutions unless they have the same parent organizations.

My 80-year-old  mom with chronic pneumonia lives in Ridgewood, I have more hope for her survival there than I would if she was in the USA, by several orders of magnitude. Even if the USA matches Italy's curve, which seems optimistic to me, she would be in the worst triage category.

Im hoping for that, its not so bad yet, but remember Italy wasn't so bad than it exploded, than italian doctors has to choose who lives and who dies. The number of cases aren't so critical now, but as it continues to rise, hospital beds are needed, and can get overwhelm, than you have a problem where people are dying because of the lack of beds than the virus itself.

To be fair, while there are issues, the US does have one of the highest rate of ICU beds per capita (almost 3x Italy, 3.5x that of South Korea and 5x that of Japan).  It also has about 1.5x the ventilators per capita compared to major economies like Germany.  While the cost side of this is insane in the US, the hospitals are clearly better equiped for something like this than most European countries.

Yup, that’s a very helpful way of knowing where you were a few days ago. But the TraceTogether app tracks _who you were near_ or more specifically (for privacy folks, particularly those who don’t like Google recoding their location) it tracks the encrypted representation of the phones you were near. 

So if it turns out you or any of them belong to an infected person, an alert goes out to the group. It’s not perfect in terms of privacy but in this situation it’s damn good. And like I say, it helps track and alert the relevant population rather than rely on a comparison of your google data to everyone else’s...

Well, for example, my dad works at a rural hospital in NM, with low risks simply due to the low population density.

Logi_Ca1,Discussion: Should the Government aggressively expand testing?,11,fom5uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fom5uc/discussion_should_the_government_aggressively/,22,1585150084.0,"Considering the rapidly escalating measures that has been put in place over the past few days, I reckon that the Government are either freaked out that new cases keep raising (many of them being unlinked), or impatient that they are not dropping fast enough. 

If you were to look at the table on this page on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing), Singapore actually isn't that high in terms of tests per population. Countries like Spain and Norway are testing more than we are. We don't have the sort of drive-in testing facilities put in place by South Korea where people who suspect that they have been infected can go to and get tested. The measures now don't really do enough to find the asymptomatic people who are still spreading the virus.

In my opinion, it's either the government bites the bullet now and test the population on a much wider scale, find all the carriers and get back to life as per normal ASAP, or we suffer a slow burn, take a hit to the economy over a long period of time with the government having to issue another stimulus package anyway.

Let's just consider this part. Let's say we spend all the money, get everyone tested, quarantine all the carriers.

How does Singapore, an international trade hub, go back to ""life as per normal"" without simply just having a second round of infections once we open up the borders? Or is your answer to literally test every single person coming into Singapore as well?

=== Author: Flocculencio===
People keep saying we should be more like South Korea but according to the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/ca4e0db0-6aaa-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) we've tested more per million of population than they have.

> As of March 20, Singapore had conducted 38,000 tests, or about 6,800 examinations per million population, the health ministry said. That rate outpaced South Korea, the region’s poster child for fast and expansive testing, which had administered about 6,100 tests per million population in the same time frame.

=== Author: Epixxxxx===
> Singapore actually isn't that high in terms of tests per population 

We are 14th in test/mil people at 6,739 ( 38,000 ), and there is only 6 countries around 10k test or more. In reference, South Korea is 12th at 6,921 test/mil ( 357,896 )

Yes we might be undertesting /s

=== Author: tenbre===
Question: are you saying that we should test healthy people? Because I think we are already testing everyone with flu symptoms.

I want to understand what is your exact proposal for who should be tested? Anyone who wants to pay for a test, regardless of condition?

Or are you saying that doctors who want someone to get tested, are unable to get them tested? Or that doctors are constrained by restrictive MOH guidelines on who is to get tested?

=== Author: FitCranberry===
we dont have the resources like south korea

=== Author: LaZZyBird===
Test the more vulnerable populations, allow for voluntary paid testing for the rest. To be honest, we are just trying to delay the virus spread, not completely stop it, till a vaccine is created. I suspect that it would be within a few months, there is so much money to be had behind this. SG is hoping to throttle, not stop, the economy, hence the half-steps.

=== Author: blizstorm===
the test is not perfect. PCR test has a pretty high negative rate of around 30%. so people whose result are negative, may be infected. the false negative could be due to the sample not taken properly, or that the person dun have enough virus yet.

that said, aggressive testing should be one of the measure, just that people who are tested negative, should not think they are safe.

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
This is my view on the issue, so what if the government actively test for it ? Do we have enough hospital beds to accommodate everybody ? Do we have enough quarantine facility for everybody ? Apparently not. 

As time pass, it would only be those with severe symptoms, e.g. signs of pneumonia that will be tested/ hospitalised. Those with mild symptoms would be told to quarantine and observe

=== Author: Logi_Ca1===
We are already doing that for people showing symptoms:

https://mothership.sg/2020/03/swab-test-singapore-travellers/

Obviously it's not up to me to decide whether is it feasible to test every single person. It could be a risk-based decision: eg everyone from UK and US gets tested, while lower risk places like Taiwan, only those showing symptoms applies.

The way I see it is this. A test is much cheaper than if a person infects the r0 value of 4. If an asymptomatic person infects 4 people, that's 4 people that the government has to pay the bills for.

=== Author: Dercong===
Maybe “testing every single person coming into Singapore” could  be something to consider in a “new normal” longer term? 

Of course this only makes sense if testing is cheap enough, and quick enough to administer / get the results.

*SAF100 joins the chat*

=== Author: CaptBobaTea===
Care to explain why not?

=== Author: 557088===
Just because you don't test them doesn't mean they're not infected. It's better to know that you have too many cases to deal with, than to have a wildly under reported number.

=== Author: CaptBobaTea===
You can only flatten the curve if you aggressively test and round up the infected. If you were to take a half assed approach to this, you run the risk of having those infected who are not identified, running around and potentially infecting others.

I agree with your viewpoint that we do not have enough hospital beds. But that's exactly why we need to identify and isolate the infected asap. You can then decide to send those with mild symptoms to specific quarantine facilities and free up resources in the hospitals.

=== Author: pingmr===
I don't think you've answer the question though - if we test everyone and then get a virus free population in Singapore, what's the next step? What exactly does spending all that money on test achieve? 

You'll just have a virus free population in Singapore, but it's not life as per normal since we still have to keep people out. Unless of course we test everyone, including the asymptomatic ones, in which case we are going to need an absurd amount of test kits. 6 million just to test our population, followed by even more to test every single traveler coming in.

If you accept a ""risk-based decision"", then isn't that the same principle behind how we are testing people in Singapore right now?

=== Author: FitCranberry===
to do what? that only brings about an unskilled, unwilling, untrained and uninformed labour force

=== Author: pannerin===
South Korea spends 60% more of their GDP as a percentage on healthcare than we do. Government spending is also nearly 60:40 vs private spending, and we have like the reverse. They have 5 times more beds per capita than we do. 

This has nothing to do with tests lah. But SK has more of a biotech and pharmaceutical industry, with production capability. 

However, we have more nurses than them, and slightly less doctors. Like Japan they don't have enough out of hospital services. 

We have an efficient healthcare system. High bed utilisation means less waste. But now it means we are not going to have enough beds in the public sector. Transferring patients to the private hospitals, especially covid patients, involves risks.

=== Author: FitCranberry===
if you can find a source to provide millions of testing kits to the government, you'll make a mint

=== Author: New-Function===
The military, in times of crisis, is largely an unskilled force. But they are called upon because it is the only organisation capable of mobilising a large amount of labor. 

You can be trained within hours to collect samples. In fact, personnel do not need to be doing the actual medical work but be an extra pair of hands to assist. This takes the load off medical staff.

=== Author: CaptBobaTea===
We were one of the first countries to develop test kits. We even used them as a diplomacy tool. As such, I find it ridiculous that we can only do 2000 tests per day.  Sure, maybe not like Korea testing 10k per day but surely we can do better than 2000.

> # Covid-19: 40 new cases in S'pore, stricter safe distancing measures including 1m separation; all events with 250 people or more suspended until end-June

> SINGAPORE - Stricter safe distancing measures will be introduced to reduce the risk of further local transmission, the authorities announced, as Singapore reported another 40 Covid-19 cases on Friday (March 20).

> Keeping a safe space around individuals is especially important for vulnerable segments of the population, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press conference.

> All events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

> Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues accessible to the public, such as restaurants and cinemas, are also required to implement measures to ensure separation of at least 1m between patrons.

> The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.""

> Employers have also been strongly advised to allow their employees to work from home, or implement staggered working hours where telecommuting is not possible.

> Non-critical work events should be deferred and critical ones scaled down to no more than 250 participants at any one time.

> ""When combined with good personal hygiene, safe distancing measures can help to slow the spread of Covid-19"", said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a multi-ministry task force to fight the coronavirus.

> He added : ""Our healthcare professionals are working hard to take care of patients. We don't want to add to their load, and therefore, it is important to add these measures to ensure our healthcare workers have the capacity to look after our patients.""

> Singapore has witnessed a recent uptick in new cases daily that has been largely due to a sharp increase in imported cases, as Singaporeans studying and working abroad return home from other countries where the number of infections continue to rise.

> Of the 40 cases confirmed on Friday, three-quarters were imported.

> There were only 33 imported cases from Jan 23 to March 9, with this number rising to 156 from March 10 to March 20.

> Imported cases have also nearly caught up with non-imported ones for Singapore's total of 385 cases.

> Stressing that is cannot be business as usual, task force co-chair Lawrence Wong, the Minister for National Development, said that the aim was to have fewer people out and about, and a reduction in social gatherings and any activity that could be a potential social vector for the virus.

> On how the safe distancing measures will be enforced, Mr Wong said this can be done in several ways.

> For example, food and beverage outlets that are licensed will have to close some tables.

> ""So it is not an option, it is not advisory, it is mandatory,"" he said.

> ""We will start tomorrow and it will take some time to roll out fully but we will aim to do so as quickly as possible.""

> He added: ""We do not want to see crowded venues, we do not want to see packed event halls. We should see more work from home, more takeaways.""

> ""We will be enforcing the rules. There will be some inconvenience but we also need all Singaporeans to cooperate. And if we are all very disciplined about this it will give us better control and enable us to control spread of virus.""

> Mr Gan had announced on Wednesday that non-Covid patients could be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals.

> He also said there are plans to convert normal wards into isolation wards, and quarantine facilities into care centres for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms if the number of cases here continue to rise.

Tbh I think Singapore should follow nyc's example and strongly limit social gatherings and restaurants. 

If community spread starts to increase (as it might with all the returning Singaporeans), restaurants might need to turn to delivery or take away only and cinemas might close.

If it gets worse, the gov can mandate x% of employees to stay at home

I hear you, but consider the fact that an asymptomatic individual on a flight may possibly infect fellow passengers. One infection could potentially bring about 10 more. 

And while queing up at customs, the individual may further infect the customs officer.

Asymptomatic individual then takes a cab, or the MRT home. Cab driver may be infected. Scores of others on the train as well.

It's better to stop the source in the first place.

Tokyo did a report on estimating the impact of peak hour travel if 1m/2m distancing measures were implemented during an outbreak, following their H1N1 epidemic. Accounting for the fact that WFH also affects the railway workforce, the volume for commuting travel could drop (be squashed by) as much as 92%. It did however also showed that if that was somehow possible, it would push down the curve by quite a bit (less people infected at any one point in time). Observations of experimenting with sitting on alternate seats concluded that this would be ""difficult to implement"".

=== Author: agentxq49===
Not just that, you'll have to test everyone, everyday, at the same time, for 5 days in a row in order to catch every single actual case, including the ones that were infected today, and preventing any person to person interaction for these 5 days.

Not possible? how about test everyone once, those who tested positive, get all their close contacts and quaratine them for 2 weeks, get people to isolate with 0 interaction.

Not possible? how about test every high risk person like those who are traveling into the country, anyone with symptoms and quaratine all their close contacts for 2 weeks, get people to minimise their interactions.

Nowadays pls lor. Most are wondering why the internet at work is worse lol.

=== Author: squarepancakesx===
Uh, my company does split teams to WFH and we also have the option to WFH permanently until this Covid situation gets better but I agree that productively levels drop out of office.

Although we're always online, sometimes it's a harder to communicate and resolve problems as people are not pedantic about checking their messages. The small 10-15 mins of waiting can add up.

We have to remember the reason they are getting tested is because they meet the criteria of coming from overseas. Most local cases have to be either been in contact with someone/come GP repeatedly/severe cases to get tested, community transmission is only detected if it fits the latter 2.

=== Author: matthew5025===
Well, yes they are, as it provides them with the opprotunity to fix trains during that period of time.

=== Author: Windreon===
>or even just think you've got covid-19, you can get tested fairly easily.

You need to provide valid reason for why you think you have it (been in contact with someone infected). You cant just go to docter and ask for testng without symptons.

I’m currently in NYC and I’m keeping track of the situation. The cases in NYC cannot be described as crazily high, but I would say it is quite high compared to the other parts of US. But I do consider what they’re doing a very good step to tackle the situation, you barely see anyone on the streets lately. 

Singapore should start doing the same before it gets worse, after all, considering the population density, all it takes is for that 1 person to spread. And also, I would advise you to take those admiration posts with a pinch of salt, we have been criticised too.

So yesterday while on the train home, this guy was slumped over in his chair. Couldn't sit straight. Kept sliding down until his legs were halfway across the carriage. I thought he was drunk so I just kept prodding his legs back into the seat with my feet and he didn't even retaliate.

Halfway through the journey, he starts coughing out loud. Doesn't cover mouth. People start to move away and give him dirty looks. He coughs into a handkerchief, then drops it on the floor and doesn't even pick it up, continues lolling around with eyes closed.

Few stops later, he *fucking coughs out a giant glob of phlegm onto his hand*. Like...enough to fill a shot glass. And the phlegm slides through his fucking hand onto the seat.

So yeah anyway I guess I'm getting Covid-20 soon.

I just read the new medical report on covid19 and am quite worried now.

I know the media and statistics have been only talking about how mainly elderly and weak people die to it but I'm not just afraid of death. 

There are new reports that if you do recover from COVID19, your lung capacity may be permanently reduced by up to 30% due to tissue scarring in the lungs. 

This may mean huge lifestyle changes to people especially if you love to do sports...

NUS just released a circular saying that every student is required to declare their temperature everyday twice a day and retain a picture of the temperature reading with a timestamp. Failure to do so can result in actions such as student not able to view examination results for a month, cannot submit their dissertations or theses for examination for 1 month etc.

I wouldn't be too bothered by it since it is important. But I am already screened for temperature before I enter my work place every single time I enter. I don't think it is necessary for me to declare my temperature to NUS. If I do have a fever, I wouldn't be allowed into my workplace and I would know immediately. Plus, I have not set foot on campus since January.

Hi has anyone ever experienced a crap Herschel zipper that splits and refuses to join again no matter how much wax and how much plier force you administer? What's the next step to tryin to salvage the zipper? I heard Herschel gives replacements under their lifetime guarantee but the nasty side requirement is that customers have to rip up/ deconstruct/ make unusable their old backpacks as verification to the company before they will send the replacement over? Sounds quite intense and not eco friendly. Does anyone have any experience and can advise?

So the govt closed down places of entertainment to prevent crowds gathering and reduce the spread of covid.

It seems like there has been a lot of misconception about the ongoing pandemic, and also mental health, amongst the general public in Singapore.

Ask me any health related questions and I will answer to the best of my ability. **Note:** I am a psychiatrist, not an infectious disease doctor, so do not expect me to know everything about Covid-19.

**TL;DR: Is it advisable to start investing at this point in time?**

Idk is I'm giving out too much info regarding my finances but I'm 25 years old and no idea what I really want with my life. 

Is it still a good idea to start investing at this moment in time? The gist is I've been working for 2 years and basically living paycheck to paycheck, with barely any savings (think <1k). I don't really have a lot of day to day expenses. I only go out like 1-2 times a week to meet my gf. Don't like to eat out. I give around 40% of my net pay to my parents for bills, groceries and ""rent"" for my family of 7. It's not much but it helps. I give this much as my big sis is preparing to get married plus my younger siblings are well young. 1 is barely a year into working, another is a year into NS, and the last is preparing for poly. Don't really buy things much except that I'm a big kpop fan (yup), and big on PS4 and Steam. and as such most of my money has gone toward kmerch, concerts and games over this past 2 years and providing for my family. 

I have been thinking for my future and this is a largely unsustainable way to live. Largely due to the fact that I've always wanted to start and reading the book ""Rich by Retirement"" by Joshua Giersch I made the decision to start this month with a sum of around 2-3k and continually add a small amount per month. However as the current COVID situation(and it's aftereffects) continues to escalate and seems like it will be around for the next half year at the very least, I'm conflicted. Basically is it a good idea to start investing right now?

Tbh - Differin works wonders but you can’t really get it OTC without a dermatologist prescription. 

Prolly better then BHA/AHA imo.

=== Author: detonatingbubbles===
I think acne is very much genetics as well. However if you get dark spots - it’s often due to hyperpigmentation (can see /r/asianbeauty or /r/skincareaddiction). Some ingredients you can look out for are retinoids (vit a), niamcinamide (vit b), ascorbic acid/different forms (vit c). Chemical exfoliation can also help in which I see you are already using BHA/AHA.

Honestly it’s really hard for me to tell you something specific to incorporate. But the incorporation of vit c, niamcinamide, and AHA has been really helpful for me in prevention and faster fading. For my friends, they prefer just the AHA but dropped using vit c and niamcinamide.

Do you pick at your acne? Because cutting down on that really helped as well.

I think u shld research on your skin type and use the correct items! 

Innisfree cleansers arent really good i realise. I switched to the chanel cleanser the non brightening one and its really good, not too mild but not too harsh also, i did use innisfree toner and serum and its decent but i just went to try chanel’s serum and moisturiser after innisfree toner and its significantly better. 

I now no longer have acne scars or acne tbh. Everyone’s skin is different tho you shld get samples and try out!

That looks like a lot of product to put on your skin during the day when you have combi skin. 

I use rohto melano’s vit c essence! It’s a popular Japanese brand and I’ve tried their moisturiser too but unfortunately they don’t carry the moisturiser anywhere in Singapore so I had to settle for the essence instead. I got it from ntuc! It’s about $16.70 for one tube w/o discount. 

I’m gonna get The Ordinary soon. They have this chemical peeling toner that I’ve been eyeing for a while. I heard it’s great for clogged skin types. You can check out the brand!

Edit: oh my bad I just read through the comments whatever I’ve written have already been recommended lol.

=== Author: noodlesaucetime===
woah that's a lot of things you put on your face. have you ensured that none of these are causing break outs to your skin? 

i have acne and i went to polyclinic and got referral to cgh dermatologist so it's not as ex as going straight to NSC or any medical specialist. late last year i was prescribed differin (cream form) at 0.1% concentration and it really helped with my white heads and scarring after 2 months of nightly applications. i saw them being sold at the pharmacy counter at watsons once, not sure if it requires a prescription to purchase. i would really recommend something like this that is 'medicated' rather than using every day skincare brands.

My forecast if the virus is going to be around for a year or more.

1. Virtual restaurants like Uber eats will thrive. Mall landlords /REITs will be affected since they went mainly food centred.
2. Air travel is going to cost a lot more.  Budget airlines won't die but their ticket price will approach full fare as the number of seats goes down.  Full fare will become budget as in-flight service will be reduced.
3. China as the factory of the world model will be tweaked.  I think SG will start producing some stuff for the medium term.  Masks, swabs, Ventilators, PCR machines.  Are there any companies in SG still doing plastic moulding?
4. Public transport, buses and trains.  This is one is tricky to solve.
5. Tourism industry-related industries will return, eventually with social distancing.
6. Those silent flatted factories will roar back to life as factories or agricultural farms eg chickens and eggs.

In the market sellers will sell either local and / or export sets. 

Local sets are all under Maxsoft - 1 year local warranty, joycon controllers 3 months local warranty. 

Considered more 'safe' as Maxsoft is the sole official distributor of Nintendo products in the territories of
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand, so no need to worry about authenticity or company collapse etc. 

Bad thing is due to the current Covid 19 situation, production and shipping is affected and you will find it quite hard to find one. 

Export sets are mostly from Japan, Europe and US. Obviously no warranty from Maxsoft but they are usually cheaper and some sellers will give their own shop 1 year warranty. 

I'd go for those if its from very established shops like qisahn. The rest u will have to research and see whether it's worth it yourself. 

As for the general trustworthiness of these e-commerce shops, just exercise common sense and see reviews / Google for info. 

If prices are too good to be true... then yeah u know the rest.

=== Author: Lapmlop2===
Do note that Maxsoft is known to be a lousy company and you may have a hard time dealing with them if you really encounter any issue with your switch. Hope they changed.

=== Author: KimJiHoon===
look at qisahn price as a guideline. Also export set can be cheaper coz no local warranty.

Relationships that start off from dating apps tend to move quickly bc of the nature of such apps. It's fine to talk to them as friends, but it's best to ask your matches out on a date as soon as possible to gauge compatibility. Totally ok to take things slow, but understand that the other party may lose interest if they don't feel anything from your side. Not a lot of people want to just chat or hang out platonically for an extended period of time. Options are aplenty on such apps for most of them anyway. It'll be easy with the right person, you shouldn't have to crack your head over what to say or how to impress them—just be yourself.

Cant think of it as a traditional fps, its more like FIBUA

you're actually in there, your field of vision is more restricted, you gotta track the bullets left in your gun mentally (you won't be able to bring up the pistol and look at the side of the magazine in a firefight), you can't reload after firing one bullet since you'll throw away the rest of the magazine, you gotta align your rear sights with your forward sights, real-life gun skills like firing with both eyes open transfer over flawlessly to VR

reloading in the heat of the moment is more difficult than it seems, getting used to actual peeking where only your head rounds the corner while your body stays behind cover, crouching, etc - i would say while it's similar to watch as a viewer, to play it is completely different, and practically none of the skills you build from playing FPS games transfer over, to the extent where i would nearly consider it a completely different genre.

Man I would have never expected this question here! I just asked the same question on the tea subreddit the other day. 

If you are planning to drink at a cafe like environment, then matchaya is hands down my favourite.

However, if you are planning to drink it at home. I’ve only tried powders from Ippodo - in which Sayaka no Mukashi is already really delicious! Otherwise you can try Unmon no Mukashi which is pricier. To be honest, I’m not great at describing how it tastes, but... uh I just like it more. 

I’ve also tried from Obubu Tea farms, in which the green of the powders are insanely beautiful. It’s a treat to look, smell and drink. For Ippodo, I think you can order from their global shop or get someone to bring back for you from Japan (when this whole situation gets better). I ordered online for Obubu - the delivery is really quick!

I’m definitely looking to try some stuff from Marukyu Koyamaen at sazentea. But honestly, I’m just trying the lower grade ones first because, good powder is painful for the wallet. :(

I think the general recommendation on the matcha/tea sub is to try from Hibiki-an or O-cha. But someone kindly recommended the Organic Matcha from Marukyu Koyamaen. Not something I would have considered but would try soon!

> Even after almost a year after the first products started shipping, Wi-Fi 6 remains very much a work in progress. Key features (OFDMA, AX MU-MIMO, Target Wake Time (TWT)) are still not enabled by most products and, if these tests are any indication, you're unlikely to see performance gains in from 5 GHz.

>If you have AX devices and feel you must upgrade right now, spend as little as possible. Until OFDMA is enabled and we see whether that helps bring more bandwidth to busy WLANs and reduce latency, there's no sense in making a large investment that may not pay off.

Get myRepublic... have never experienced any down times. If you play certain games, sign up their GAMER package and get dedicated connection to the server you play. They also have some pretty sweet deals when you sign up.

You wait. Singtel will call you to offer $10 off a month. Or you can call them to ask for it. Just threaten to switch provider. This will make it one of the cheapest deals in town. With the added benefit that you do not need to install anything new, just carry on as normal.

All of them are fine, just get the cheapest one for you. Maybe stay away from ViewQwest since I've heard some bad stories. Such a shame too, they used to be one of the best...

M1 if you just want the absolute basics.  
Starhub if you want TV. Be prepared to change the DNS.

As a Singaporean, I find it interesting how many Americans are comfortable telling me that Singapore is a police state, despite never coming here. It's almost like we can form opinions of a place without having to go there. Not saying it's necessarily right, but it's just something all people do. And people tell you their opinions on America not because you're Asian, but because you are American. Who better to talk to about it? If someone tells me they're American of course I'm gonna bring up your retarded leader. If only to make small talk and see where you stand.

My only regret was it is a little heavy on my \[messenger\] bag (everytime shoulder pain), should have gotten a LG Gram instead, lighter than my XPS.

Either way, still pretty fking expensive considering the price pre-covid19 but honestly I don't see them getting cheaper anytime soon esp when the switch is in super high demand rn.

 A relationship is a stool with many legs:

- sexual chemistry/compatibility
- friendship
- intellectual compatibility
- similar interests
- similar goals.

You can have a chair with 5 legs, and it's very stable. 4 legs is also fine. 3 legs makes an adequate stool. But you can't have a chair with 2 legs.

Focus on your savings first. Don't think about investing until you've saved up 6 months of cashflow for emergency purposes first.

=== Author: zalesa===
No. If you have to ask whether it’s the right time to invest, it’s probably not the right time to invest. Investments are only effective if you have the money, knowledge, conviction and risk mitigation plans in place. If you lack any of those, you’ll be dumping stocks like people are now and losing your all your capital buying high and selling low before retirement.

You mentioned being a kpop fan and console gamer(I guess?), to get your emergency savings, time to limit your spending like maybe 1album from your favourite idol groups or 1 console game every few months or so.

With regards to investing, i would recommend holding out a bit more and doing your research before starting to invest!

=== Author: AWPrahWinfrey===
Calm down. How many weeks/months away is your trip? If the situation continues to be at a level that warrants this level of border closures and travel restrictions, I'm sure the airlines will extend the penalty-free refunds, especially given that you booked months ago and not after the restrictions were announced. Since you booked through an OTA, go to them via email. OTAs can get refunds from the airlines for you. Also, if the airline cancels your flight (Etihad has cancelled all flights that are not going to Abu Dhabi so yes, your flight is essentially cancelled) they'll refund you for sure.

Most of my friends just laugh at whatever he says and call him an idiot. It's true that Trump Derangement Syndrome is prevalent but Trump brought it upon himself for saying such retarded things and overall being an absolute horrible human being.

=== Author: soonnanandnaanssoon===
Tbh, I don't put the full blame on Trump for proclaiming chloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID-19. However, I do think it is irresponsible for him to proclaim it that it is safe and ""doesn't kill people"". Yes, he said that. [1] Chloroquine can be lethal at twice the dosage for it's recommended use for COVID-19 for patients below 50kg [2]. 

Scienctific advances and preliminary reports have been taken out of context and twisted into many stories countless times before. However, it is unethical to falsely report scientific progress for the sake of sheer morale, especially given the current global climate of tension, worry and fear which can drive people to act irrationally out of desperation. 

Is Trump purely to blame for the death of Nigerian patients overdosing on Chloroquine? I personally don't think so. It is far more likely the patients read the report released before Trump's statement and attempted to take things in their own hands. However, is Trump to blame for the current spike in chloroquine purchasing? Yes, I do think so. And I do think what he did was unethical and lacked the psychological and social considerations that leading doctors, epidemiologists and clinical researchers will take into account before releasing such a statement in this context. 

Minor correction, the scandal should technically be the Chloroquine scandal. Hydroxychloroquine is far less toxic and than Chloroquine, and thus far less likely to cause mortality via lethal dosage consumption by the general public.

=== Author: mantism===
it's popular to hate and blame Trump, nothing new here. I'd be more surprised to find people supporting him openly, actually, especially after that xiaxue incident.

I don't expect there to be as much people literally frothing in the mouth over his election (and potential re-election), save for a few US political diehards, however. Mostly it's just casual politics discussion, mixed in with some emotions, when talking about whatever that is trending politically currently.

=== Author: musr===
His initial tweets claiming that the urgency of COVID-19 is a democrat hoax, dismantling the pandemic response team set up by Obama and lacklustre or even absent initial response before March 17 is enough to put the majority of the blame of the US situation on him.

He's literally trying to rewrite history now and ride on the waves of being a war-time president for the purpose of reelection.

Thanks for the reply! I have tried TO niacinamide and Melano Cc earlier on when getting into a routine but didn’t notice a difference. 

I recently ordered a bottle of TO niacinamide to try it with my current routine but got a fake bottle from Shopee. 

I should get one and try to see if there would be any difference now.

=== Author: wemw===

Thanks for the reply! I have actually tried TO niacinamide and Melano CC earlier on when getting in a routine but didnt noticed any difference. 

I recently tried ordering another bottle of TO niacinamide to try it out with my current routine but i got a fake bottle from shopee.... sketchy stuff man...

=== Author: sipth===
Thanks for your reply! But ouch Chanel stuff a little too expensive hahaha

=== Author: sipth===
Yes, tried once a few months back. Unsure if i should spend the money on facials or a derma. ( not sure the price diff tho)

=== Author: sipth===
Thank you! I will definitely try it out. Any take any help i can get haha!

=== Author: sipth===
Yea, I am wondering if I can cut any products. I've been recently feeling tightness around my cheeks which is my main problem area. I think it might be too dry so i'll cut back the AHA for now.

=== Author: sipth===
I actually made the mistake twice on my SCA / AB routine where i just slapped on tons of new products at once and never really noticed any massive purging or breakouts. Too desperate already hahaha

Yea, I think getting a referral to NCS seems to be the best bet.  I'm kinda sick of this trial and error.

I see what you mean. Its just a difference of ideology. Americans prioritize free liberties and believe in minimal government interference, therefore we believe the governing style of Singapore is outrageous. This is of course an ignorant viewpoint as if they really came to Singapore, they would realize that as long as you follow the rules you wont be bothered. On the flipside, Singaporeans believe in the ""government knows best"" philosophy and believe the governing style of America is outrageous. 

&#x200B;

My personal opinion? No one has the right to tell one another which governing style is superior, as everyone has different priorities and outlooks in life.

I know how to but I choose not to because there are psychologist for that and limited time in clinical settings. A psychiatrist is for diagnosis and prescription; I recommend a certain form of psychotherapy to the psychologist and they perform it. 

It has been very successful in terms of depression and anxiety. A lot of patients have been able to stop pharmacotherapy altogether because they find that they are able to cope without the need of medications as a clutch.

Yeap. It kinda has to do with being the oldest son, so I want to give back to my parents while I still can. It's a lot but like I said, I'm not a heavy day-day spender and i won't be contributing as much if/when I move out as well.

I think if I stay disciplined I can be financially stable. I've managed to get a decent amount of savings before its just that my lack of discipline means that it will suddenly and violently be used up haha.

I've only managed to read one article (the teacher one) but it looks good. Can't believe I've never heard of this one before.

Was at McDonalds. Saw someone sitting on those long tables.  
A few teens walked in, and 1 was looking right at the sticker.  
The lady explained that they were supposed to not sit on the sticker.

Teenagers being the usual pricks (been one) decided to be an extra prick, and sit right at the sides of the lady (she was at the edge where there was 1 seat, and the ones on either side had the sticker).

There was enough space for them to not distance themselves away from her, but no. They decided to be assholes about it. She seemed upset, and rightfully so, so she got up and left. Pricks just laughed.

That was not cool at all.

[Wikpedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome)

That term usually refers to people who are 'deranged' about Trump to the point of blaming anything and everything on him, less so about Trump himself.

Of course, that's not too surprising with how pronounced Trump and his position as POTUS is and the current state of social media.

Weight training helps also btw

=== Author: darkglave===
you should try HIIT. If you are motivated this works really well.

and like that guy said, weights help also, cuz build muscles = burn more calories when resting. 

diet also helps, as in eat less carbs more protein at meals.

Ah yes, our local degenerate is back at it again with yet another alt

=== Author: sp______ce===
Hope it works for you! It’s helped even out my complexion imo and has really helped prevent breakouts. Also note that you shouldn’t use it at the same time you’re using vit c (if you are). Vit c is more effective in the day so personally I use it in the AM and niacinamide in the PM. just FYI!

Malaysia. I managed to get it in Singapore without a prescription though. Depends on who's the pharmacist.

=== Author: squishysoft===
Yup, you can get differin otc at guardian/watsons pharmacy. But to treat acne scars, you need a higher % strength which requires a prescription.

=== Author: S7nyx===
Np, the one I mainly get would be Differin (Adapalene) 0.1% by Galderma. I remember my derm sells  it overpriced so I always sourced it myself through overseas Pharma. Just remember to slap on some moisturiser & sunblock while using this, result takes a while but worth it. Good luck !

=== Author: squishysoft===
You can order TO products from lookfantastic.com! The selection might be a little limited (some products are perpetually out of stock) but it's free shipping and definitely genuine.

=== Author: detonatingbubbles===
Anyway I agree with other replies to figure out your skin type and your skin concerns! 

I’ve used melano CC before but I’ve personally switched to stratia for most of my routine. (Not sponsored but I truly truly wish!)

But as opposed to product recommendations, figuring stuff out is a process.

Mistakes I’ve made: introduced too much too fast so I had no idea what was working, what was causing problems, introduced stuff that’s too heavy leading to more problems, tried acids too quickly, became obsessed with ingredient lists, trying new stuff too often

What helped: figuring out my skin type, figuring out the extent of exfoliation I needed, and with the reassurance that my clogged pores (my main problem) would go away with exfoliation with time, I stopped picking them stopped getting so many hyperpigmentation spots (which also went away faster with niacinamide).

Anyway if it really bothers you, you can probably see a derm, but TBH if it’s not very bad you can probably try it yourself first? Some of my friends have improved after better diet/stress management/changing pillowcases. Honestly hard to tell if it’s the routine or the environment that’s the issue.

And facials are painful (on my wallet and face as well haha), after I started my acid routine, I stopped getting clogged pores and stopped facials.

Good luck!

=== Author: bryansng===
Yea it is TT but you can ask for samples to try it out! Because if it works, i think its a good investment, because good ass skin is Priceless 🥰

The basic cleanser is $66 which is pricier than most cleansers but imo its worth it!

=== Author: littlepancake__===
Ooh yes, your cheeks are probably dried out. Does your skin feel tight after washing? If it does, it’s probably the cleanser. Just pat the AHA on other areas and slap on more moisturiser on dry areas. 

When my skin gets dry I just skip everything and go straight to the moisturiser. It works for me so I’m not sure about you.

Also with the assumption of ""If I tell you to work from home you won't be working.""

Lol just msg the seller and ask about origins la.

Sales platform like shopee and lazada slightly more regulated than places like carouhell. Look at the sellers profile and check their sales history and general background.

Ppl out to do good business won't risk sullying their reputation, especially when all information (like reviews, performance and etc) are laid out for all to see.

Plus shopee only release payment once u confirmed u have received the goods. If there's any disputes, you can always msg them for assistance (yes there are horror stories but at least you know the support exist)

If u are still not assured, then go physical shop best. Play-e, gamemartz, qisahn all very reputable. Won't cheat u. However note qisahn recently on a down curve, lotsa complaints about their service and handling of prices and pre-orders. Your mileage may vary.

Don't think there are shops here that sell many different brands. It's a young, small and expensive market, too risky for shops to hold many brands and stocks. Most people get their VR headsets directly anyway if I'm not wrong.

The VR arcades gonna cost you.

VR game dev shops are your best bet. If you know someone and they're not busy then perhaps they can entertain you.

Or keep looking out and finding VR headsets in the wild, like public exhibition or shopping centres (not likely during this pandemic).

Or meetups (again, pandemic).

Yesss! I truly love making my own matcha though even if it’s not as cheap as one would expect. It’s just super peaceful to make it, and something to look forward to PLUS you get to have as many as you want at anytime - though I try not to drink it after 3pm because too much caffeine makes me unable to sleep.

And I get it too! I definitely directed some of my food budget to sustain it. There’s just so much to explore, I’ve spent so many hours just browsing, but I decided to start off on the lower end first because I’m afraid if I love the expensive one... that my matcha budget gotta be that big.

But if you ever decide you want anything from sazentea, I’m not sure if it would be cheaper to share shipping? 

I also lurk on the instagram matcha community! They do reviews occasionally. To be damn honest, I don’t really get the tea notes, and energy of the tea. But it’s great to just look at beautiful tea and teaware.

No offense taken but i feel it's a non exclusive situation. The efforts of the government is focused on mitigating the effects of the outbreak on the population. But for the school wise, I feel the consideration should be on how to maintain the standards of education for all students as everyone is affected, and failing which, it should consider mitigating the impacts on the student. I don't see how this would affect the efforts to assist the nation in fighting the virus.

The racism wasn’t too fun. And in general the culture isn’t really too flexible when it comes to their rules/norms. It made me realise that what made Singapore fun for me was that decent amount of chaos in day-to-day life. Plus, living abroad gave me a lot of perspective into how pretty damn good the government in SG is. take the current COVID19 situation, japan barely tests people and even people with shown symptoms for at least a week get denied testing because “they’re not connected to a known case”.

Yes, I also made the mistake of slapping too many products on at once. Honestly the most of the products on my current routine was started together. 

At this point I dont really know what is helping and not but I dont seem to be getting worst so Ive been running with it.

tho I seem to have some tightness around my cheeks now which I am guessing is from using AHA every alt day. Might be too drying.

I think the COSRX BHA is super weak so most people recc to use it daily else it might not be effective.

My current skin isnt the worst. Some hyperpigmentation / scarrin g on my cheeks. And always have 1-2 active pimples on each cheeks at all times which will then turn to scar even if i dont touch it :(((

School closing without a proper mitigation measure won't help keep them at home. This is a point that many has already point out.

123dream321,Reasons to hold early election,0,fopauc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fopauc/reasons_to_hold_early_election/,17,1585167413.0,"Why do you think they want to go on with an unpopular early election ? 

My opinion:

Firstly: I do not agree with them to hold early elections now but I do think what TCH had said makes some sense. 

Let's say the solutions/measurements they have for covid and incoming economy recession is highly unpopular with the people but considered necessary by them. Baring in mind that PAP did create policies that are unpopular with the people. Without mandate from the people, 4g ministers will be much more reserved in going ahead with such decisions, scared that the people give them the boot. Which will directly limit their choice of actions.

What he say just further convinced me that we are going to have some drastic measurements / policy coming our way that are going to be very unpopular. Such as prioritizing economy over  life.

Not that I agree with him but trump said it ""we cannot let the cure be worst than the problem"" I'm sure he isn't the only one with this opinion. 

 
For them to make this move, this is the only reason I can think of. So why do you think they want to hold it early?",2020-03-26 04:16:53,"

=== Author: YouYongku===
GST vouchers before election

haha

=== Author: caseback===
Actually the reason is quite simple. If we assume that it will get worse, we should have it now instead of waiting to hold it in the future - more uncertainty on danger.

Constitutionally we need to hold elections by April 2021. If infection rates are relatively low now, we should do it now. If we wait until April 2021, we may experience higher infection rate then (e.g. 200 per day). At that time, it would be greater risk to public health to have elections.

Uncertainty works both ways, contrary to State media papaganda.

=== Author: jdickey===
PAP are famous for *telling us* they make the difficult choices, taking bitter pills for the declared good of the nation (especially when that happens to coincide with the perceived good of the Party).

Since we have no other real POV allowed in mainstream politics here, unlike any real country, we appear to be stuck. People have always been afraid to vote their best interests; now, they're (justifiably) afraid of being required to vote at all.

Read again. I said I don't agree with him but others may have the same opinion.
There are many idiots around , see the nightclub cases and so many businesses still not wfh.

=== Author: blitzmango===
So question is how likely is the infection likely to be higher 12 months down the road than now? I'll be quite worried if the numbers a year later are as high or higher than present day.

=== Author: jdickey===
Of course it's taking advantage of the situation. Opposition parties can't hold rallies, present effectively, and so on because of the (necessary yet oh-so-expedient) rules in place preventing it. The PAP have media organs (newspaper, radio, TV) to be able to get their chosen message across and slam the Opposition at their leisure.

February would have made sense from a practical point of view. June or July will make far more sense from a control-and-pound-in-the-message point of view. Every month the election is delayed *while restrictions are in place and enforced* is an invaluable gift the Party can give themselves.

=== Author: blizstorm===
nope, and if PAP is true to their reputation, they would do it before an election

=== Author: etyn100===
At the same time , this cripple economy for long period of time or get it over with it attitude to the problem at hand both have pros and cons.

While rigorous contact tracing is there, it doesn’t mean that the cases would be linked from the get go. It requires tracking and accounts from the patients and their next of kins to determine the possible routes of transmission.

I’ll take giving those people a week to track down a potential cluster or links to previous cases. Meanwhile we should do what we can. Social distancing of ideally 2m but if not possible, 1m. And try to stay at home if possible, outdoors only when absolutely necessary like grocery shopping or medical appointments etc. and finally practise good personal hygiene. If you have masks, you can opt to wear them when outside.

We **should** write down who/where/when we meet daily or download the app.

Most of the new cases are imported and supposed to be on SHN. The contact tracing should only take a short time to verify:

1) Who lives with you

2) You didn't leave home except to go to the doctor, right? Which doctor, when?

The numbers of local transmission cases don't seem that big, especially compared with the massive amount of contact tracing that must have taken place after the SAFRA Jurong incident. 

So I'm a bit worried. Worried that those returnee who came back before the SHN for Europe/US managed to transmit by difficult-to-trace routes (taxi driver, public transport, food courts, supermarkets etc).

=== Author: simonhtz===
*Contact tracing intensifies*

=== Author: -furmint-===
I think they will actually ask you every little detail you can remember(heard from people & read somewhere).

There’s already many unlinked cases, highly likely some came from abroad. Which is why I think we should do what we can by writing down or DL app. 

At least if we got sick we won’t be saying “sorry, I cannot remember rn”

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
The contact tracing for those on SHN should be quick. Of course for those who aren’t, the investigation will be long and detailed.

> 

> The new app will not replace ongoing contact tracing efforts, but it will facilitate the process, enabling contact tracers to inform users who are close contacts of COVID-19 cases ""more quickly"", the press release stated.

> For a start, authorities hope to use the app to establish 25 per cent to 50 per cent of these close contacts.

> 

> “This enables users to take the necessary action sooner, such as monitoring his own health closely for signs of flu-like symptoms. Early detection could potentially help reduce the risk of the spread of the virus, and better protect our families and loved ones,” the release added.

> 

> The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group will be working with the public and private sectors to raise awareness of the app and encourage its adoption.

> 

> PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS

> 

> The authorities stressed that the use of the app is voluntary and that users have to give ""explicit consent"" to participate in TraceTogether.

> 

> This consent can be withdrawn anytime, according to GovTech.

> 

> The app also has several layers of security and privacy safeguards in place. For example, users will submit only their mobile numbers after downloading the app. Each phone will then be assigned a user ID.

> This user ID is then used to generate temporary IDs, which will be changed at regular intervals. It is this temporary ID that is exchanged between the phones of TraceTogether users.

> Such regular generation of temporary IDs protect users from eavesdropping and tracking overtime by malicious actors, according to GovTech.

> No other personal detail, such as names, will be collected. Neither does the app access a user’s phone contact list or address book.

> 

> The app also does not collect or use location data of any kind, such as GPS.

> ""The app doesn't identify 'where' the exposure to COVID-19 cases may have occurred. It only seeks to establish 'who' else might have been exposed to the virus,"" according to the TraceTogether website.

> This means that location information can only be established by contact tracers during verbal interviews, it added.

> All TraceTogether logs will be stored locally on the users’ phone in an encrypted form.

> 

> “The logs do not contain the user’s phone numbers but a set of cryptographically generated temporary IDs,” the joint press release said.

> 

> “The logs leave his or her phone only when he or she uses the app to send the information to authorities to facilitate contact tracing,” it added.

> 

> Even then, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user’s data as these logs are only deciphered and analysed after the user sends the information.

> 

> Other safeguards include how the app will only be active during diseasee outbreaks. For instance after contact tracing ceases, the app will prompt users to deactivate its functionality.

For the people worried about privacy, all your privacy already went out the window with apps like Facebook and Instagram. At least for Trace, theres a social good achieved in exchange for any privacy lost.

=== Author: 5k1u30zp===
I know for Android, I'll be going into permission settings and block location, wifi and 3G permissions to the app. 

They advertised the app as only recording proximity and no location data. Data is also stored locally and not transmitted online. Only if I get infected will contact tracers verbally get my consent to have the data. It's only fair to have location and internet permissions revoked then, gives me a peace of mind.

Edit: Location permission has to be granted to allow bluetooth LE to work, Google says it's a feature. App still works after revoking internet access(after initial set up).

The application is limited only to Singapore's account. Probably your friend has set Malaysia as his country in his IOS/Android account.

it is possible to change the account's country, although I think it is easier to create a new one.

=== Author: thefibrobee===
There’s no mention anywhere that it’s only for Singaporeans - which, if so, would reduce the contact tracing effectiveness, given that a large number of our population is made up of foreigners living and working here - so it could be an error.

i believe its when someone who has this app is confirmed to have COVID19, MOH will use this app on their phone, and will notify anyone who had prolonged contact with the infected person, and hence issue a SHN/QO this way. As people are not guaranteed to be able to remember 100% who they have been in contact with

> Can't the government already track everyone?

No, they can't

=== Author: ThatAndresV===
It doesn’t track *where* you are. Read the news story or watch the video on the website.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
Location privacy is not exposed in this app, but cross-referencing it with other apps that geofence your location, or even with some simple native apps (like the camera, for example) that incorporate your location by default, will easily expose where you’ve been and the duration you’ve spent at the locations. 

So yeah, ultimately using a smart phone almost already 100% guarantees your location is not private, just that having this other application that sort of shows who you’ve been in contact with compounds that. 

Again, small price to pay for safety, and I trust the government when they say they will deactivate the system once the situation is over (obviously, else political backlash). The only thing is to make sure it is secure and robust.

=== Author: obwama===
Yeah Google was kinda sneaky to put the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sniffing stuff under location permissions, since that is what is was mainly being used for. They reassure that its only stored on device, so they should be able to be held to their word

I have.

CCTVs don't track where you are either, but they can find out where you are at a certain point in time. When aggregated, they'll paint a very good picture of where you are at all time.

Well it's a limitation of android that Bluetooth low energy needs to have location permission to work, so I can't turn it off.

I can turn internet connection off though, so it should be fine as they can't have a real time record of my location. If i get infected, I'll already be disclosing my movements to contact tracers, so it wouldn't make a difference.

=== Author: aRisingStorm===
I also had to turn off my VPN to enter my phone number, but it seems to work normally when I turned my VPN back after that.

=== Author: aham_brahmasmi===
> Still it tracks who you interact with. Some people might not want to share that. 

Isn't this the point of contact tracing? You may be a good Samaritan and divulge your location if someone asks for it for the purpose of contact tracing but many times you may not remember all the little details and lying about your location for the purpose of contact tracing and land you in jail.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
I see. I’m on iOS so I don’t know how Android phones work. 

But then again most of the time low energy Bluetooth is used for exactly that purpose, to “announce” to a location that it is there, so I guess that’s why it’s linked together as one setting.

That's a big issue imo. As far as I know gov stance on companies has always been ""should/encouraged/advised"". I wanna see stronger words, or even enforcement. Not wait until companies break the law, only then bring out the hammer.

Edit: I'm aware that not all companies are able to have their employees wfh. But to those that can but are not doing it, I wanna see some action. Heck, even for the general public. People are too non-chalant. I feel that many won't adhere to safe distancing unless it's being enforced.

Ive said this in another thread - many government agencies with staff doing non-critical work still have NOT implemented work from home (they already have the tech infrastructure set up for work from home but senior management just likes seeing everyone in the office)

exactly, my company just enacted WFH for two weeks just for the upper management to see then everyone was recalled back to office and everything went on as per normal. Sad to say most Sg companies need enforcement before they’ll do something

=== Author: Joanne7799===
Unless working hours between nearby companies stagger, maybe some can end earlier instead of all ending at the same period. CCAs are stopped so less students but still, it’s pretty much impossible and there’s no way to limit because some people take train for long distances so spaces are occupied travelling from one end to the other.

It's not just the working hours. Even during off peak it is difficult (but not impossible) to get a 1m distance. It may mean you miss a train or two, or have to walk a few cabins from your original boarding point but it is doable. 

Good luck getting people to leave empty seats though.

Most are not caught at airport i think If u look at moh reports, there is usually a 4-6 day period where the affected are at home / out in public. This is like 65% of cases. The rest usually come to sg and go hospital the next day ( this is terrible.. it means they were symptotatic and knew it while boarding). With the new 2 week shn , however , i think no need to worry tho. Just practise good hygience and social distancing.

> The suspension of services comes after a member of St Andrew's Cathedral was confirmed on Wednesday to have contracted the coronavirus.

> The church member, who had been in the UK, attended a service last Sunday but had no symptoms of illness and passed precautionary screening, said the cathedral.

> 

> When the member attended a 9am service on Mar 15, the screening teams cleared and admitted 324 people into the church, the diocese said in a letter to church members.

> 

> This was done after social distancing measures were implemented to limit the size of the congregation.

> During the cathedral's closure, the affected premises will be ""professionally disinfected"", the letter added.

> 

> The average weekly attendance of Singapore parishes is about 21,000, according to the diocese.

> 

> Bishop Rennis Ponniah told Anglican leaders in a letter that the decision to suspend services was made to ""intentionally create a two-week break in church gatherings"".

> Online weekend services and pastoral care for the elderly and vulnerable will be made available during the suspension.

> ""Our churches will make the needful pastoral provisions to continue caring for and strengthening the flock during this time,"" said the diocese.

I believe the proper term is for most non-denominational churches is Pentacostal.

And afaik, Anglicanism has elements of both Evangelicalism as well as Roman Catholicism. I might be mistaken on that front, so do correct me if I'm wrong.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
I think they most certainly overlap. Pentecostalism and evangelicalism are complex terms that elude consensus among christian scholars.

But Pentecostalism is generally regarded as originating from the early 1900s Azusa street revival in Los Angeles, while evangelicalism has roots back to the religious ""awakenings"" in Britain in the late 17th century and several subsequent waves of piety since then.

 ""And afaik, Anglicanism has elements of both Evangelicalism as well as Roman Catholicism. I might be mistaken on that front, so do correct me if I'm wrong.""

Yes, coz this depended on the beliefs of the ruler of England then. Hence, Anglicanism tends to have some elements of both.

Yeah, over-dependence on

I won't disagree, at the same time it's not going to solve a lot of problem here in SG even if we move away from foreign manpower. 

Just because we are now having to deal with Malaysia's lockdown doesn't mean it shouldn't be the way going forward in the future with regards to foreigners working in Singapore.

This is going to be unpopular but I never welcome the idea of minimum wage. Sure it looks good for everyone, but at the same time it'll be mostly dumped on consumers to pay the difference, other countries are easy to notice on how much price change when it's off the shelve in a supermarket and in a dine in area.

Disagree that minimum wage is not good. The concept of minimum wage is to ensure that wages are at minimum living wage. The only problem that developed nations face is setting the minimum wage at a higher unsustainable wage.

=== Author: isparavanje===
The problem with minimum wage is that it's basically welfare from an invisible tax (due to inflation). That tax, however, is regressive, and the welfare is poorly targeted. See this example from the US: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/typical-minimum-wage-earners-arent-poor-but-theyre-not-quite-middle-class/

More than 30% of minimum wage earners come from households with incomes of over $60k/year. Why should they get any welfare? It's much better to call welfare welfare, instead of using poorly-targeted market instruments that kinda help some low-income families but not very well, funded by an regressive tax.

=== Author: bbfasiaolang===
No. Minimum wage is too blunt a tool. Sg govt alr got surgical tools compared to the large stick that is minimum wage. Stuff like workfare etc

=== Author: flabberwabber===
Erm... this is wrong on so many levels. 

1) Wages didn’t get “depressed”. Education rose. Educated people don’t want to work in low-skilled jobs. 

2) Policies don’t “depress wages”. Companies and demand and supply do.

3) Low-skilled workers’ wages have upstream effects, such as for example, your transportation fees, your housing costs. If you want higher wages for them, don’t complain when everything gets more expensive. 

4) Japan is a monolingual society, and there are immigration policies set in. Cultural reasons and red tape prevent foreign labor. Still, go to Japan and you’ll find foreigners working the cashier counters at 7-Elevens and Family Marts. In Australia, [29% of the resident population is born overseas.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-born_population_of_Australia) Also, [1 in 10 jobs go to foreigners,](https://www.afr.com/politics/one-in-10-australian-jobs-relies-on-foreign-investment-new-study-finds-20180819-h145v1) and [one-third of them earn less than half the minimum wage.](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/29/a-third-of-australias-foreign-workers-paid-less-than-half-minimum-wage-study)

=== Author: FitCranberry===
nope, capitalism ho!

=== Author: doc-tom===
>We already are. This will certainly reduce but not eliminate foreign labor as there are limits to automation.

Then we should let the sectors (e.g. construction, MICE and F&B) that are heavily dependent on low-skilled foreign labor shrink and those that are less so grow. The availability of low-skilled labor encourages these sectors to grow at the expense of other sectors that are more capital-intensive.

=== Author: bondbandito===
LOL koolaid working. Never for a second think that workfare isn't a way to provide an industry for the 'upskilling' SMEs or think that it works. In any case, it's not just a skill problem but job theft from depressed wages of foreign labour.

=== Author: doc-tom===
>Policies don’t “depress wages”. Companies and demand and supply do.

Come on lah. This is just neoliberal sophistry. Obviously, the massive influx of low-skilled workers will push up the labor supply and depress wages. 

&#x200B;

>Low-skilled workers’ wages have upstream effects, such as for example, your transportation fees, your housing costs. If you want higher wages for them, don’t complain when everything gets more expensive.

Low-skilled workers also discourage automation and drag industries down the value chain. If you have a lot of cheap low-skilled workers, labor-intensive industries like F&B will be more competitive and grow at the expense of other sectors that are higher up the value chain. Because land and capital are finite, these labor-intensive industries will use up more of these industries at the expense of industries that use skilled workers. The wide availability of low-skilled workers also discourages automation and investment in R&D. 

&#x200B;

>Also, [1 in 10 jobs go to foreigners,](https://www.afr.com/politics/one-in-10-australian-jobs-relies-on-foreign-investment-new-study-finds-20180819-h145v1)...

That is not what the linked article says. It says ""Overseas-owned companies underpin the jobs of one in 10 workers who on average earn $20,000 a year more than those employed by local companies, according to a new study on the [importance of foreign investment to the Australian economy](https://www.afr.com/news/we-shouldnt-be-afraid-of-foreign-investment-david-littleproud-20180115-h0itiz).""

As you all know about the covid-19 virus, many of you think that it's all being exaggerated. That quarantine is useless. That it won't affect you. You're all complaining about not being able to see your friends, family, significant other. But if you ignore the government's advice to stay home, what happens if you got infected? And you infecting others? Even if you are healthy and wouldn't die from the virus, an elderly might be, a baby might be, and that'll be your fault. The taxi driver you sit in an enclosed space with, the commuters you come in contact with on public transports, the people working in an enclosed space with you, they're gonna be suffering too.


Have you ever thought about you overloading the hospitals? That people who needs it more can't be treated because of you being selfish? Have you read up on the situation in other countries? There are countries with insufficient test kits and people are infecting more people without even realising it. There's an incubation period of 2 weeks where there's no symptoms shown and you could very well be spreading it. There isn't a cure for it right now, the doctors won't be able to save those who are in critical condition. They are going to see a patient slowly deteriorate knowing they can't do anything about it. 


Those who work have no choice but those who don't, please stay home. People are worried about the economy falling but if the situation continues to worsen, shops would have to be closed, companies would be forced to layoff employees, people would lose their jobs, people would no longer have income to support their families, mass recessions. Isn't it worse? 


So please stay safe and keep others safe too.


Edit: im not scared or like going crazy paranoid, i just hope people would think of the bigger picture. There's a thing called chain reaction, you never know how things would end up. I'm not saying people should stay home completely, just avoid unnecessary contact with large groups of people especially in enclosed areas.",2020-03-24 08:41:41,"

Where do people typically go to 'party'? Do they go to places like Zouk? If so, maybe people are waiting for the government to close down those places instead of just requiring or encouraging temperature checks. Some simple-minded people may be thinking that if the government allows something, it must be OK, and that if it's not OK, then the government must ban it or at least expressly discourage it. So when you ask them to take precaution specific to their situation, they don't believe you.

Just want to point out normal flu also doesn't have a magic cure. It's just vaccines. Once you get the flu, it's only supportive treatments mostly.

But yeah, it's best to still stay home and be safe, cut down spreading.

You guys can look at the recent few press releases, many 20+ year old Singapore confirmed cases. With overseas travel yes but they are still young people.

It's the people who are getting about and mixing that's keep popping up, not 10 year olds who go to school.

=== Author: crngpnts===

=== Author: BayleyToKairo===
Some of these young people will only realize when they actually gotten it. Not wishing it upon anyone but if that is the case, they have no one to blame but themselves. People around you are going to suffer from your actions and you will only cause pain and misery to family members whom you have infected unintentionally. 

There is a time to party, drink and get wasted but now, it is not the time. If you still refuse, then enjoy living the rest of your lives, bearing the burden that your irresponsible actions have potentially caused someone to actually die from it.

=== Author: eeeeempu===
I have been very cautious since the first case came to Singapore. Work and some groceries only. Went out for dinner with friends 3 times since January. I’ve tried to minimize my commute as well by walking. I try to keep my distance from colleagues, like arms length (1m). But most of the people here, including my boss, think I am “too concerned” or “too scared” or “paranoid”. Btw, I am an FT, and yeah I am scared. I’ve been wishing they are right since this started, but the cases keep coming.

=== Author: Book3pper===
I take enough precautions that I don't need to be lectured on thank you very much.

I lived through SARS, I was on the frontline for H1N1 so I definitely know what a pandemic is like.

Right now, there are wayyy too many emotional posts like you without considering what the context is.

The cases are high now but our government has prioritized this and made sure that our system can cope and if you look at the community spread, it's actually low. Right now, the focus should be on emphasizing that those who are on SHN ACTUALLY stay home and to encourage people not to travel. What you seem to suggest is blaming the general public for not taking it seriously when there's many measures in place already.

Does that mean we should congregate and spread the virus? Of course not but there seems to be two extremes. One being ""don't care so much, just party"" and then there's people like you going ""The VIRUS!!!Think before doing"".

I would say most fall in the middle being that they take precautions but at the same time, maintaining semblance of normalcy. I don't go out to seek out crowds but I still go out on occasion because I don't want to be cooped up at home all the time.

Even then, I go out mainly to swim and then back home. Right now, the higher risk lies in those who just came back overseas and it's important to monitor them so they don't violate their orders.

So brah, take a chill pill and let it play out.

Am i one of those ""paranoid"" people right now thinking that we are just a few days away from other countries and there's just no escaping it.

Its just a matter now for someone to make a mistake and you just happen to be on the wrong time on the wrong place.

I send my kid to school every morning via 30 min ride bus to Yishun and its just absolutely a nightmare. i wear face mask and gloves, long sleeve clothes and i have my own ""hazard kit"" with n95 mask, alcohol wipes, safety googles just in case someone in the bus starts badly coughing.

and yes they do, and im absolutely INFURIATED to see that they cough in the bus and no mask. i just move away from them or go down immediately (double decker bus).

i see people holding on to rails and then touching their nose, face, or biting their nails.

I am really paranoid. But last year, i endured a very painful biopsy on my left lung for having contracted a very rare fungus infection. 
The Ang Moh doctor said it came from a bird poop and i probably inhaled it. 

Considering i work from home, i will never know how i got that. Took me 6 months going back to Hospital for various treatments. 

So yeah.. im paranoid.

The following are some interesting stats to put things in perspective. The numbers look authentic although I have not verified the source. Interesting to note is that of the 290 active cases, the highest infected group is age 20-29. (21 Mar data)

AGE GROUP

5 are 18yo (youngest) and 19yo

72 are between 20-29yo

57 are between 30-39yo

36 are between 40-49yo

52 are between 50-59yo

48 are between 60-69yo

16 are between 70-79yo

Hold on a sec. If the elderly and those at risk are not out and about in the first place, then how would young people be infecting them? Who is the one being irresponsible and selfish here?

Not that I agree with young people partying at this time. But I fail to see how those people at risk are going to catch the virus unless they are outside in the first place. And if they are outside, what are they doing there in the first place? Dont they value their lives?  


If a young couple living on their own decide to go out and party, how are they going to infect these people at risk? Unless these people at risk are out in the same place as them...

Just travelled back from overseas, serving my SHN right now.

I totally get what you mean, but it can't just be compared to a normal flu. I've also observed the trend as you mentioned, many 20+ year olds, especially from the UK bringing it in.

I was at the airport yesterday, on the same flight with some of these individuals, angmoh-accented, students from law school in full bravado (they're talking real loud from two rows away, caught the entire conversation). They're the other end of the spectrum compared to those who are flying while fully-suited up with goggles. As the thought goes ""it's just another flu"" to them, we're chill, don't get hyped up.

While we don't go full-crazy paranoid, and try to achieve some sense of careful, rational normalcy, it's this ""just-another-flu"" attitude that would kill some. There are some who look young, healthy and fit, but might be immune-compromised from pre-existing conditions. There are older folks vulnerable.   


Looking at the stats, if they carry on with attitude coming back, with or without the virus, it'll just inflate the curve instead of deflating it.

If you take 21 mar data:

1. Skewed towards 20-29 yr old as a lot of returned students from UK, one of the epic centre with no control till recently. Effective/lack of social distancing don’t really apply to them.

If it’s for the sake of the “youngster stay at home” argument, would be better to look at local cases only.

Though highly likely the data will skew to the elderly instead due to the church and Safra clusters.

On the other hand, given how small Singapore is, any cluster forming like club gathering or old folks home cluster will just skew the range again and f*** us.

These at-risk individuals don't always have the privilege the remain home. It's a chain of events: some have to work near these 'party-goers', or maybe their relatives do, then inevitably bring the virus home with them.

=== Author: Wxlfiexx===
There's families with elderly and young children, working adults who go home to them. If the adults/teenagers get infected, they would go home and infect those who are weak to the virus. Also young people are not immune to the virus, there's many who are infected and are currently hospitalised/quarantined. Imagine them overloading the hospitals when many who are in need can't get treated. Again, there's currently no known vaccine or cure found to fight against the virus.

I understand that some elderly may dislikes frequent bath/shower but i think for Hygience purposes,we should teach them to always clean ourself,not just our hands but our body & hair.

It also time to tell them not to go out often(i know they are often bored at home,so do us) but we have to follow the Gov order so that the healthcare staff has less patient to work.

For those Mummies out there,do stay strong & to Daddies out there,do limit your social contacts especially if you have a young child at home.

However, businesses are still trying to stay operational as much as possible.

One thing to note is that Singapore is a very tiny place and also extremely densely populated. Life still has to go on. 

 
As of today 20th March 2020, we have 40 new cases.

The total number cases, cumulatively, in Singapore is 385

Out of that total of 385, the total discharged is 131 (infection free). 

The total remaining in Hospital, is 254. 
 
Of the 40 new cases, 30 are imported cases with travel history to Europe, N.America, ASEAN, other parts of Asia, 7 are linked to previous cases, 3 are currently unlinked

Of the 254 cases remaining in Hospital, 16 in ICU.

All Events with 250 or more participants are suspended till 30 Jun. 

Public venues such as F&B, entertainment are trying their best to ensure 1 meter gaps among between customers and patrons. 

There were some loopholes here and there. For example, during the 17th of March 2020,there was a flood of migrant workers crossing the border without facing a mandatory 14 day Stay-Home-Notice. That loophole has since been closed.

But for quite sometime before that, measures at the border with Malaysia were not what I myself considered to be adequate. To me personally, it was alarming because it was one of the busiest border crossings in the world, with over 300,000 Malaysian workers crossing that border on a daily basis, which continued till the total border shutdown and closure on 18th March 2020.

The government also came up with an app today to implement contact tracing: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-trace-together-mobile-app-contact-tracing-coronavirus-12560616

In terms of mask supply, it is not so good.

3M does have a small factory in Singapore producing the N95 respiratory mask but nearly all surgical masks are imported from outside the country and given the current global situation, they have become a rare good.

One of our GLC (government linked corporation) actually has a mask production line in Taiwan but since the Taiwanese government had banned the export of masks from Taiwan, the authorities are looking to move that production line back to Singapore. But there had hardly been any news on that and I personally suspect the Taiwanese government may be blocking the removal of the production line.

no we havent recovered. I think we're only just starting.

about 100 of the cases in the last 5 days are imported and is likely to increase as we recall more citizens home.

in fact we just tightened some more distancing measures, but life hasn't grinded to a halt.

here's the data dashboard:  [https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7e30edc490a5441a874f9efe67bd8b89](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7e30edc490a5441a874f9efe67bd8b89)

=== Author: Epixxxxx===
The increase of cases (from recalling of citizens overseas/imported cases) would hopefully stabilize 2-3 weeks from now and most of them would have recovered in 4-5 weeks.  
NCID is 173/330 beds at the moment with room to expand to 500 beds if there is a surge in the near term.

=== Author: Boogie_p0p===
No way. We're now in the 2nd phase of the fight (imported cases vs the initial phase of community spread). We had a large influx of people (both residents and visitors) this week due to border control measures and there will definitely be asymptomatics in the bunch. So we're expecting cases to be much higher within the next two weeks plus some.

For reference, this week is week 9.

We had our notice for the cancellation of exams this week and our new exams at week 13.

Effectively, they are giving us ~3 weeks to prepare for our final exams and most people have between 3-5 of these. All of them are cramped in a single week, some are less than an hour apart. Week 13 would be the date that they teach the last chapter of our lessons on normal pacing.

This test will also contribute between 40-60% of your overall grades. It will cover ALL chapters in that module.

Donate all the coffee you have to any NTU students you know, they probably won't be sleeping for these few weeks...

> # NTU students upset over multiple last minute assessments after exams cancelled due to Covid-19

> As a precautionary measure against Covid-19, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) announced on March 14 that most semester exams will be converted into continual assessments.

> This may be in the form of tests, quizzes, terms papers, projects or other assignments.

> For some, this may seem to be a rather innocuous change, meant to combat the spread of Covid-19 within the campus by employing social-distancing measures.

> However, the sudden announcement was a rude shock to many affected students, as the change in assessment format meant that multiple new deadlines have sprung up, mere weeks before the end of the semester.

> Many students have spoken up on the anonymous platform NTU Confessions, detailing their difficulties in adapting to these abrupt changes.

> Mothership spoke to several NTU students regarding the announcement, and how they affected students from various faculties.

> New deadlines were imposed at a short notice

> Normally, semester examinations in NTU are conducted after the end of the teaching semester, with a study break of between one to two weeks before examinations are held.

> However, with most exams being converted to other forms of assessments, students have reported that their deadlines have been brought forward to the end of Week 13, rather than the traditional exam period, typically taking place after Week 13.

> With the announcement made four weeks before the end of of the teaching semester, students are understandably upset about the situation.

> “My workload is already quite heavy because of FYP (Final Year Project), and the other electives that I’m taking that are purely continual assessments. Now, the exam is pushed forward a week so it’s two days after my FYP presentation, and also during the same week that a lot of my assignments are due. So it’s going to be a challenge to balance everything,” said a fourth-year Communications student.

> This sentiment was echoed by another student, who is a third-year Literature student.

> “Before this change, I had four essays, one in-class test, and three final examinations. All assignments were equally spaced out and a study break was included before finals. Now, I still have the essays due during the semester, and three in-class tests and one take-home test all happening during the last week of university, sans study break. Safe to say there won’t be any time to study or prepare for the essays.”

> Many NTU students also said that shortly after the announcement was made, their professors informed them of the new assessment deadlines via email, with many of them stating that “academic rigour would be maintained”, despite the changes.

> Professors provided swift updates, but did not explain the changes clearly

> While the students generally appreciated the quick updates provided by their professors, they were less pleased with the way that the information was conveyed to them.

> “It was first made known to me through email. I received different emails from different professors for the respective modules. The content is more or less the same saying that the decision of the Provost is the reason for the change and that’s pretty much it,” said a fourth-year Physics student.

> Students were also concerned that the new forms of assessments would be of equal difficulty to the original examinations, only brought forward.

> “There was no explanation on the scope of the new test papers that were brought forward, so I assume academic rigour being maintained means papers of equal standards, merely brought forward,” said a fourth-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) student.

> The same student remarked that while he understood that the Covid-19 situation is constantly changing, the school and the teaching staff could have explained the changes in a more coherent manner.

> “I think they could have done better by at least explaining the scope of the new papers or how our learning schedule can be adjusted for us to be prepared for the upcoming quizzes and assignments. None of us really had the time to react, but it doesn’t seem like we have a choice, or that it would make a difference,” he said.

> Many of the students that Mothership spoke to were also not content to simply observe the situation from the sidelines.

> Some students have already emailed their professors to discuss a possibility of pushing back the deadlines, but they have not received replies as of yet.

> A third-year Literature student also shared that her faculty has created a Google Sheet document to share their views with their professors.

> At least one student, a fourth-year Mathematics student, said that it was difficult to negotiate with the professors regarding the new assessments.

> He said that although several students tried to work out alternative arrangements with their professors due to multiple clashing assignments and tests, they were not open to letting the students discuss alternative solutions.

> NTU previously told students to keep their schedule open until the end of May

> According to NTU’s previous announcement, 25 per cent of examinations will continue, although they may be postponed up to the end of May, pending new developments with the Covid-19 situation.

> NTU has advised students to keep their schedule open and available until the end of May, in case there are any changes to final examination dates or continual assessment schedules.

> It is unclear whether professors are given the discretion to push back assessment deadlines in a similar fashion as well.

> Mothership has reached out to NTU for comment.

7 quizzes/tests and 2 submissions on week 13 halp

=== Author: DismalHamster===
I see my homies in NTU and NUS being equally as steamrolled over (or maybe even worse). Next week is technically the last week of class for us. (week 12). Revision week is week 13.  

We went online sometime between week 6 and 7, they had 5 weeks to decide what to do, but no, they are still running around like headless chickens wondering what they should be doing... 

As of now, they are holding the line at physical exams will proceed as per normal...not to curse anyone, but if people start dropping dead (or become disabled due to to prolonged oxygen deprivation) because of your stupid exam and  because of a lack of ventilators (aka Italy), channel 8 will be so impressed with our capabilities in producing such good drama without even trying. 

Sometimes I wonder if under the guise of  academic rigour will be maintained TM that the administrators and academic profs who run the show have zero common sense as a skill set to utilize. 

Don't want to deal with all the admin bullshit, cheating and stuff? Just allow you students to choose Pass/Fail grade, let us type that shit on MS Word. Done. 

Academic rigour will be maintainedTM my ass...people are literally dying out there, it is difficult to concentrate, and I don't even know if I have a job waiting once I am done with my final 2 exams because there is a chance that firm will close shop permanently. (yes, this is my last semester).

=== Author: wunderbare===
Hope they reconsider the way they're going about this. 75% of the exams were cancelled, while the remaining 25% had their dates shifted. Some students getting fucked over by their exams being turned into CA aside, anyone with a brain will know that shifting the dates for the remaining 25% isn't going to help anything.

If in the off chance they're actually shifting the dates around to reduce the number of exams in one day and splitting everyone into different places, why isn't this communicated clearly? Based on circulated information, this solves nothing and it seems as though some people are getting royally fucked over a bandaid that was stuck on the wrong arm.

=== Author: TheurgyWarden===
Even with bellcurve applying here, the changes affect all the students taking the module equally and every students have different electives and core modules. This meant as 75% of the modules in ntu changes to CA as finals, many students are unable to cope and prepare in time. For instance, a student having double degree vs someone who only had 16au(least workload possible).

Bellcurve exist to select the best of the best but the playing field must be even for it to do so.

=== Author: BiocMii===
Academic rigour will be maintained^TM because everyone will have an equally short time to study, so bell curve could save you /s

=== Author: BiocMii===
They say it's a precautionary measure for COVID-19

Basically they want to announce that they cancelled exams and prevented mass gatherings, but at the cost of letting 75% of the students take their finals 1-4 weeks earlier. Also CA = not mass gathering???

we get through mostly safely > makes both PAP and opposition look good for knowing whats best for the country and that stability is best at this time. win-win for everybody.

Physical voting at the ballot box is compulsory in Singapore  - s 43 of the Parliamentary Elections Act.  


This means Ah Ma, Ah Gong, Ah Chor all have to physically go. Election booths are coronavirus  formites - touch pencil, touch face, remove mask to see face, put mask back on. These are vulnerable populations - if they kena, their odds of dying are north of 5%. Think of it - 5% of our parents and grandparents dying.  


Then all the newly returned Singaporeans also have to vote etc....add 10 asymptomatic cases voting and spreading to everyone, we're done.  


If conspiracy theorists ever needed confirmation that  gahmen is trying to kill you....

Your average voting location (which tend to be a rather large school compound) is not even that crowded. Give every voter a free pen and gloves if y’all so scared. Vote, get it over and done with. So we can move onto more pressing things.

When Vivian Balakrishnan was interviewed on CNBC, he stated that the government stance on the election right now is wait and see. Solve the outbreak and see where it heads.

=== Author: Initial_E===
The way I see it, we don’t have a choice. A government can do a lot of things but the one thing it can’t do is get to say how long it remains the government of the day. We need the clear mandate to push through the difficult decisions that will surely be necessary in this season of crisis.

I give you our northern neighbors as an example. Muhyiddin’s government has a serious problem with getting their states to fall in line, because he lacks the aura of legitimacy. Today he needs to lock down the country and fast. the individual states are pushing back saying they will do whatever they want, keep their *churches* open and other populist actions that will make them look like the hero. Because he is not, in their minds, the true leader of the country.

Yeah we can’t have things devolved to that level here, we will perish.

I seriously find it more crazy people are getting so obsess with blaming the PAP for being irresponsible to call for an election right now when they have not and probably isn't even planning to call for one.

For those of you clowns thinking PAP will take advantage of the ""crisis"" vote. Well I have news for you, a recession is coming. they don't need this crisis, they can easily use the next one, once the situation have calmed down somewhat. Either way, most sane voters won't be voting for clown cars, the unknown and a party with a record of being incompetent to pull us through the recession

I want to vote pap asap to support them for the good work they done

=== Author: cinderhawk===
I think my main issue is really - accountability. I'm not convinced by the ""we need a strong new mandate"" argument (on the grounds that it is absurd to assume that a government necessarily needs a strong mandate to implement strict measures to save lives!) 

I can see where people are coming from on the ""well, when is there a good time?"" front. Thailand is apparently now projecting that COVID-19 will take two years to clear up. But right now, the writing on the wall (at least from the test balloons) appears to be for [an early May election](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge-could-be-held-in-early-may-if-virus-outbreak-stabilises). The threat from COVID-19 is real. Countries don't go into lockdown and seppuku their economies for no reason. What's going on in Italy (that death toll!), in the EU (especially given their commitment to open borders!) and Iran - and what went on in China - should be persuasive enough that COVID-19 is a significant deal and that it really would not beggar belief to defer elections in the light of COVID-19.

Next, there is a significant amount of leeway between now and April 2021. At the very least, nothing is harmed by waiting a year. The situation may yet change (vaccines, influence of warmer weather, control measures achieving success.) Even if the situation doesn't change, it seems strange that the elections are so urgently demanded that we have somehow lost out by waiting to see how things fall out. It's not like waiting for a year necessarily entails that we will have to postpone the elections past April 2021 and open a new can of worms, if Parliament can even do that at all. Forcing an early election when there is still the option of time is a different type of decision from being forced to have an election.

But my bottom line is this: yes, we've been reassured there will be appropriate risk management measures. Say they fail. This is a scenario in which we go to the polls, and in the week after, it becomes apparent that we have (a) cluster(s) that emerged as a result of polling day, simply because of our insistence on rushing the elections now. Can the government (assuming the PAP makes it back into power) be held accountable for this decision? Does anyone really think this is going to be an issue in the elections five years from now? 

I think about pre-election assurances in the past and the post-elections reality, and I'm not really sure that the government would not choose to swing much closer to managing the economic fallout and taking less robust containment measures, because ""life must go on."" They've signaled as much. Elections are an imperfect tool but they appear more effective at ensuring responsiveness to the public's preferences and desires.

=== Author: realteeheeboi===
It may sound crazy but holding the election in the midst of a crisis will benefit the PAP as the population tend to prefer a safe pair of hands to tide over the crisis. PAP knows they have to quickly capitalise on the good work done so far or risk holding the elections in more uncertain times (the situation can possibly spiral out of control). The PAP is not dumb. I’d argue it’s a smart and calculated move on their part. Irresponsible? Yes. But it’s PAP up to their dirty tricks once more.

=== Author: asdfgMaster===
It’s to the ruling party advantage right now. People are panicking and they tend to vote for stability. Online keyboard warriors (may be hired, idk) view them as being very competent despite numerous shortcomings for handling of COVID-19. Through the crisis now, they can prevent people from congregating at rally speeches which the opposition ones are mostly filled. So yeap, you have your answer.

=== Author: greenerapple===
This right here. They're playing on people's emotions. Change will not be good during a crisis.

=== Author: sitsthewind===
Agreed with this.

I suspect that we're seeing the election news coming out now so that most (if not all) opposition parties are on record calling for the election to be delayed.

If the election does end up delayed (the worst case scenarios I've seen is this will take [18 months to blow over](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-plan.html) which will bring us to after April 2021), then the opposition can't come out and say ""oh, the election should have been held earlier"" since they've already called for it to be delayed.

I agree. 

If I were the opposition, I would want to wait for things to go really bad - recession/ job loss/savings depleted/discontent/frustration/anger. During these times, voters would want change/breath of fresh air. Opposition could definitely play into the emotions (anger, despair) of people to get them to vote for them.

If the PAP could call the elections tomorrow, they would, as a worsening global economy would not do them any favours.

I hope the politicking in this regards remains low, but every team will do what they can to win.

1) They do have a deadline to hold it. 

2) The ruling party had always been a better safe than sorry when it comes to this kind of things. Doing it now capitalized on the positive vibes from their handling of the crisis. The opposition also typically do not have a platform to bring their message across except during election times. Now they can't hold rallies, house visits or even shake your hands and they can't use the TV either. How are they going to reach out to auntie uncle voters? The opposition can do all of those things during a recession. 

3) pap is not looking to win the elections. They want to dominate it. They want to ideally win every single seat everywhere. So yes they definitely will hold it now

4) just because you have a view that you think is good does not make other people clowns

Well, it's more because [the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee report was released](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/general-election-ebrc-electoral-boundaries-grc-smc-12535200). It was formed [six months ago](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/electoral-boundaries-review-committee-formed-prime-ministers-office), so their report was past due.

I agree though, and further suspect that it's the PAP floating a test balloon to see what kind of reaction they'll get for each of the scenarios.

(For what it's worth: I prefer leaving it till the last moment. Hopefully this global effort to fight COVID succeeds, and we'll return to some semblance of normalcy by National Day.)

At the end of the day, it’s still a win-win for PAP. 

If PAP win, good for them. 

If PAP lose, the change of government will make the local situation even more hectic (see what happened when Malaysia changed their PM recently) - the change in the political scene will definitely lead to chaos in crisis (like for example, the new leadership will have handle their new duties, as well as the crisis at the same time - this will not end well); this will reflect badly on the opposition. 

So, win-win!

> It’s Covid-19 infections season, and Singapore general election is threatening to appear around the corner, and that means the opposition Workers’ Party members of parliament are still out and about to meet with residents.

> WP chief Pritam Singh shared a post on Sunday, March 22 of his team mates doing exactly just that in the Aljunied GRC’s Paya Lebar ward as they conducted their regular walkabout.

> As talk of maintaining safe distancing becomes more frequent given a new wave of Covid-19 infections in Singapore due to imported cases, the WP MPs sought to understand the concerns among the common folk on the ground.

> In his post, Pritam wrote that through his conversations, it was clear that there are privacy concerns about the new Singapore-made contact tracing TraceTogether app by the government, as well as resistance towards downloading it as it makes those with the app susceptible to being held accountable by the law for withholding app information when required to furnished them.

> Pritam also highlighted and allayed the concerns about maintaining a degree of anonymity when using the app and the claim that the app is battery depleting, but lamented that such concerns should occupy Singaporeans when the fight ought to have been solely geared towards eliminating Covid-19.

> Pritam wrote: “It is unfortunate that this debate takes place when the national focus should be singularly trained on defeating Covid-19.”

> However, this also raised the importance of Singaporeans freely asking difficult questions as it is their right to do so as citizens, especially those pertaining to the increasing use of technology in this day and age.

I am really wondering, how is the entire world starting to really become strict on their social distancing measures, yet we in SG have malls offering free parking to shoppers to encourage people to shop. We have no plans to shut down of restaurants/offices despite the spread continuing an upward trend the past week. Public transport is business as usual, will probably pick up once school starts next week.

Plus students returning from EU and US in the end of March, we should be doing more than just issuing SHN. 

Businesses will get affected, so what, the whole world is gonna be experiencing the same shit(unless you have been going short).

Everyone who thinks this is game over, calm down. So many of these new cases are returning Singaporeans from overseas - you know that the government will watch them like a hawk during Stay Home Notice (SHN) and prioritise their testing. This reflects the government recently recalling all its citizens from abroad, whether working, on exchange or doing internship. It makes sense that they spend so much time in areas like the US and UK, some of them will get the virus. This is inevitable. But their chances of local community spreading is extremely low, especially because government is now checking nearly every single person on SHN to make sure they abide by these orders. 

Since these are imported cases, it is not a sign of the virus spreading “uncontrollably”. Rather, it’s just people coming home and realising that they caught the virus once they got tested. The next few weeks will see a similar spike in number of cases as these Singaporeans take the first few flights home after the “official recall”. After which, as long as they are carefully separated from the public, this will die down too.

=== Author: chaujie328===
To those who are scolding govt for not closing schools / shops / MRTs etc... We have to realise that govt have to strike a balance between economic survival and precautions. Closing down malls and MRTs and all are only short term measures. No matter how large our reserves are, they are finite. It is not possible to give money to businesses for a long time. And you do realise that when businesses die, our jobs die as well? Unemployment will rise and you are speeding up the recession and maybe worsening the impact of the recession on Singapore. 

So what govt is opting to do is to do aggressive contact tracing to ensure it doesnt spread too aggressively in our shores. And it is working. See rhe daily updates. Most are from overseas. Imported. Very few are local transmission. 

We should not compare with US/Europe. Because these countries have not been doing their work. And now they need a major ""circuit breaker"" to reset the numbers. I suspect they will slowly undo their measures once they see effect and the numbers drop.

Rather; lets look at Hong Kong, Taiwan. Countries who have been battling this virus aggressively since Jan. Their controls are not as tight as Europe. Even China. Their measures used to be tighter than Europe. And then 1 month later, they all are being loosened right now. Even China realise how unsustainable these measures are.

Hmm, maybe MOH can implement a new rule along the lines of:

Singaporean residents who have (non-essentially) travelled to countries with travel advisories against will have to pay for their own medical expenses if they contract Covid-19. Should stop the aunties and those who insist on travelling by dangling a few thousand dollars worth of medical expenses.

Logic: Those people are the ones who are buying cheap tickets now and going: aiyah won't kena one. This should make them think twice.

I have been saying this. Singapore seriously was too lax on closing border with Europe. They shut borders with whole of China when its infections per capital were about Europe's about \*3 weeks ago\*. Yet they freely keep letting many Europeans in without at SHN notices.

Border with every European country should have closed two weeks ago.

And US too. That place is a quagmire.

In fact, China is about one of the safest countries to keep borders with - with one the lowest active infections per capita in the world.

EDIT: I of course agree Singaporeans should be able to return, but the mandatory SHM 14 days should have been issued 3 weeks ago.

=== Author: stop__waitaminute===
that still makes it 14 locals infected, iirc that’s the highest number we’ve seen yet?

=== Author: gretsall===
I'm just very annoyed that people in my circle or friends on my feed are that are travelling during this time. I have friends who are in Japan right now in the middle of their trip. Glad that they have to serve SHN when they return. I wish we could have stricter travel bans. Too many people are thinking so-and-so country is safe so they just carried on with their trips anyway. NO, just no. Do our fellow citizens a favor. Do not bring back the virus and overwhelm our hospitals :(

=== Author: BR123456===
Think with this spike in cases, can see a few things. 

The number of Singaporeans abroad is pretty significant. Am currently abroad myself as an international student and it’s been chaotic all around. MFA released a statement encouraging us to all come home too so it’s not just exchange students returning in droves. People want to know the consequences of going home now in terms of course progression etc, but that’s running against the clock with airlines shutting down rapidly. 

The ways in which other countries are handling this pandemic are really inadequate. The local transmission in other countries has to be quite high for it to hit so many Singaporeans who have managed to get home so far, when the rate in Singapore itself is relatively low. 

Honestly I’d rather be home in Singapore because even with this spike it seems more under control - at least it’s getting intercepted at the airport and not picked up in a GP clinic somewhere after the person’s walked around their whole neighbourhood. But I don’t know if I’m already infected and simply asymptomatic, which is the worst time to be going home to be with people with weaker immune systems than mine since it’s the most contagious. I don’t really want to ride a plane ride for hours knowing that at this point there’s likely someone onboard with the virus. I don’t want to add to the already spiking numbers we’re seeing in Singapore and become Case 400 (hopefully we don’t reach that number), contributing to the panic.

Edit: can I commend Singapore on its transparency as well. Nowhere else (on english news outlets at least) have I seen a more thorough breakdown for every single covid19 case. The thing that’s scaring me the most is uncertainty and a lack of information of wtf’s going on. I know the clusters in Singapore, I know who’s imported and who’s not, I know if specific cases have recovered or not, I know who’s linked to who. I can understand that it spreads at bigger gatherings from the evidence, and can understand the importance of social distancing - therefore I’ll actually do it. 

Meanwhile other countries are more interested in keeping their “number of cases” low - which doesn’t help in quelling the panic on the ground. Can’t even buy necessities for a week now because of the panic buying - Singapore stocks up the shelves really quickly. On the other hand people are still having large gatherings because they don’t see how easily it explodes at one event. School shutdown? It’s a time to party ‘one last night’. Not to mention the fake news. 

The impact on the psyche of a society really matters based on the way the news & government work together to handle it.

Wow this really put into perspective to how infected the other countries are.

=== Author: isparavanje===
People are calling for more social distancing, but really, it's not that simple. If you flood the market with currency while people aren't working due to shutdowns, there'll be supply-side inflation. That can quickly lead to stagflation if one isn't careful, which might make things even worse as hospitals can no longer afford medication and people can no longer afford food. 

The shutdowns in the US and EU work in the short term, and are an attempt to bring the scale of their local epidemics back to controllable levels. If it works, they can then attempt to do what singapore and South Korea are doing, and use widespread testing to keep the spread under control. This is what the government is suggesting in Singapore too, but the growth has not triggered more measures, yet: https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-remarks-COVID-19-Outbreak-12-Mar-2020


>Besides medical plans, if there is a spike, we will also need additional social distancing measures. These will be temporary like suspending school, staggering work hours, or compulsory telecommuting. They will be extra “brakes”, to be implemented when we see a spike in cases. The extra brakes will slow down transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and help bring the numbers back down. After the situation improves, we can ease off and go back to the baseline precautions.

This is a very scientific way to deal with it, and I'm quite impressed that the government came up with this plan before the recent Imperial University study suggested it: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/

(see Fig. 4 of report 9)

Essentially, because this virus has spread everywhere, there's going to be an international virus reservoir independent of what singapore does. Thus, it's unrealistic to expect that we can get rid of the virus in one fell swoop and we'd be ok from then on. We have to use measures that are sustainable, and use more draconian and less sustainable measures sparingly but as needed to ensure ICU units remain under-capacity.

Contact tracing will soon be useless as more and more get infected. Already there are loopholes in this system. For example: A going to meet C. A has the virus and along the way, took public transport and infected lots of Bs. Contact tracing can find A and C but B is where the problem is. 

More need to be done but we might be too late already. There are more cases than we think. For every confirmed cases, there are many others walking around not tested and spreading  it.

Schools church and any non essential activity need to go online.

=== Author: SteaksBacon===
The imported cases is going to keep rising in proportion as the epicenter of the spread shifts from China to other Western countries and most ASEAN countries which have either ignored the virus threat or are horribly incompetent. Singaporeans returning from those countries is going to contribute to that number also. Got to be honest here, did anyone seriously believe Indonesia and Thailand when they reported almost no cases for weeks?

Between the ""herbs can help you fight the virus"" and ""we might be genetically immune to the virus"" shit that some foreign politicians are spreading, not hard to see why they would suppress information and not want to test suspected cases. There's now an explosion of cases in ASEAN.

=== Author: fantomz===
I also think travel should be stopped for all SGreans way before now. Non essential travel at the very least. But looking at some travel agencies Facebook page, it’s clear that they are not helping at all. A Europe or US tour costs a person at least 4-5k. Most go in 2, or a family. That’s min 10k worth of $$ that the tour Operators are refusing to refund a single cent. even on a famous tour operator site, I’ve seen ppl leaving comments as near as 12 March when cases already started to explode in EU/US. That she was rejected outright when she asked if she could postponed her trip. She was not even asking for refund Nor cancellation. The response she got was she will not get a single cent back if she do not go as planned. 
Maybe the government should do something about these. It’s very worrying that majority of the new cases seem like middle age to elderly ppl going to these countries on group tours. (Covering lots of Europe countries in few days)

I am not very happy with two days given for SHN for residents. It should have been implemented immediately. I am hoping number of travellers coming in is anyways less, now there will be mad rush to beat the SHN. 

For non residents they should have given respite of two days for them to cancel their travel plans.

Everyone panicking and coming home now - where the local healthcare system is better and not as overstretched. MFA also sent notice to encourage Singaporeans to come home. So this increase is not unexpected. 

At least govt impose the 14 Days Stay Home Notice to ensure those returning do not infect others.

=== Author: sonertimotei===
Correct me if I am wrong. 

It seems most of the short term work pass holders are just coming here for treatment. I mean work pass is just a temporary permit which allows them to work here anytime for a short duration. And they do know that they will be quarantined for 14days if they are coming from affected countries so...

=== Author: gtuckerkellogg===
Singapore's contact tracing has been impressive, but self-reported. Any thoughts as to whether the govt might provide a contact tracing app as discussed here? [https://045.medsci.ox.ac.uk/mobile-app](https://045.medsci.ox.ac.uk/mobile-app)

I reckon many of them are expats too. Most of them don't give a shit about this virus. I've seen some expats on my ig feed who went Phuket for a fitness boot camp run by a British expat in singapore himself last weekend. Bunch of 7 of them expat guys going Phuket during this time for a fitness bootcamp when they can be socially responsible and conduct the bootcamp here in singapore instead of going Phuket. Totally unnecessary. 

Also, school holidays this week, be prepared for a surge over the weekend and next week when irresponsible parents still bring their kids on a family trip during this week. Seen a few of my both local and expat acquaintances on ig story taking their kids for holidays this week. Good luck to them.

Am a long term resident in France. Just returned home from France as I wasn't confident in the measures implemented by the French govt to flatten the curve. My flight home was half filled - mostly students and working adults returning home.

What are the chances to pass the virus on to your family members if you serve SHN and subsequently tested positive? Considering that you are mostly confined to your own room and keep save distance from family members when passing by common areas?

To be safe, my family vacated the flat for my 14 days SHN to be safe since there's a lot of imported case from EU. And considering the amount of Singaporeans returning, I hope they are socially responsible to do a proper 14 days SHN.

I wonder what the rationale is for asking sg students in eu/uk to return home. Healthcare systems in these countries seem adequate enough to deal with the virus. If the students are relatively safe where they are, seems like an over-reaction to perform this 'recall', and inadvertantly increase travel when we should be reducing travel at this time. 

Are they are trying to get everyone back before the situation worsens and MFA has to expend more resources evacuating citizens?

I am jealous of Singapore and how logical most of your public policy is, not that there aren't things I disagree with but no country is perfect.

There's still no widespread community transmission. Only 5 cases were unlinked, the rest are linked or imported. There is still relatively low risk from catching COVID from a random encounter.

=== Author: dittotan===
The origin of each case matters. If there were 10 confirmed cases reported, and all 10 were imported cases, then it makes no sense to discourage domestic consumption within the country. We cannot compare with advisories coming from US or European government because their local transmission cases are higher than imported cases. That being said, once the number of local transmission cases pick up here in SG, i would expect the same advisory.

Hit the nail on the head. I was just passing by CCK and Holland V on the way home and Good Lord there are so.many.people. Esp in CCK it’s jam packed to the max I’d literally hit someone if I walked backwards. It’s as if there’s no virus at all right here in Singapore or maybe it’s people telling themselves about the hot weather making it less dangerous(???) or they’ve given up alr. Imo the Government is being way too chill on this matter.

=== Author: psgvaincra===
Same here at Star Vista this evening, packed restaurants, people queuing outside like it was business as usual. No precautions whatsoever. The country did well in managing early stages, but it's a different ballgame now. We're getting complacent. 

As an aside, with all the food hoarding going on, why are people still eating in restaurants? Don't they have mountains of Malaysian green vegetables to eat before they go bad?

=== Author: Varantain===
> We have no plans to shut down of restaurants/offices despite the spread continuing an upward trend the past week.

I think the government is deciding when to apply the next brake on social activities, and is also figuring out how to compensate the restaurants/offices/shops that will undoubtedly be affected by rental and manpower costs when such measures are implemented.

=== Author: chaujie328===
I don't think the govt is being too chill. But they have to strike a balance between economic survival and precautions. Closing down malls and MRTs and all are only short term measures. No matter how large our reserves are, they are finite. It is not possible to give money to businesses for a long time. And you do realise that when businesses die, our jobs die as well? Unemployment will rise and you are speeding up the recession and maybe worsening the impact of the recession on Singapore. 

So what govt is opting to do is to do aggressive contact tracing to ensure it doesnt spread too aggressively in our shores. And it is working. See rhe daily updates. Most are from overseas. Imported. Very few are local transmission. 

We should not compare with US/Europe. Because these countries have not been doing their work. And now they need a major ""circuit breaker"" to reset the numbers. I suspect they will slowly undo their measures once they see effect and the numbers drop.

Rather; lets look at Hong Kong, Taiwan. Countries who have been battling this virus aggressively since Jan. Their controls are not as tight as Europe. Even China. Their measures used to be tighter than Europe. And then 1 month later, they all are being loosened right now. Even China realise how unsustainable these measures are.

=== Author: haikallp===
Yeah. Just look at Singaporeans now. Hardly see anyone sanitizing their hands or wearing masks. Feels like we are returning to the lifestyle it was before Covid-19 started. Malls, Gyms, Cinemas still packed. We are getting complacent ans rely to much on the government.

i saw one lady at takashimaya today coughing vigorously, sounded like she was wheezing even and she was out shopping for plates. she coughed into her hand and proceeded to touch a plate. lmfao.

=== Author: thefibrobee===
Yes there are lots of such people and they are mostly the ones who aren’t wearing masks (in particular the uncles, aunties and elderly). Thus I think all countries short on masks should take a leaf from what Taiwan did - their govt appealed to textile companies to start mask making production lines, for which, when companies stepped up, their staff personally flew to Germany to buy and bring back the mask-making machine parts so as to shorten the shipping process, and now they have enough masks to go around PLUS excesses which they’ll be sending to US (https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fkl0vc/taiwan_to_donate_100000_masks_per_week_to_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) all in all an incredible feat but seeing how they can do it, all other nations should too, rather than continuing to tell us that there’s no need to wear masks if you aren’t sick or having symptoms.

Because it possibly only takes one prolonged encounter in close proximity (e.g. on public transport) with an infected person who’s either socially irresponsible and choosing not to mask up even when they have symptoms, or they could be asymptomatic. It’s down to us to protect ourselves. The decreasing daily infected count in Korea is a good example of the effectiveness of encouraging everyone to mask up.

=== Author: woohwaah===
The problem is SG is not proactive in their testing within the population. Many cases are those who had symptoms and went to doctors and eventually were referred to get tested.


Of course there will be many ""imports"" when the main focus of testing are on those returning from overseas.


If you think that the lack of locally transmitted cases reported is a true representation of the actual situation, I don't think that is the case. I had a feeling since last week that things were going to kick off in SG soon... and unfortunately it seems like it's about to happen.


I hope I am wrong, but I don't think I am and I don't think the SG govt/people are taking things seriously enough.

=== Author: antimornings===
One fatal drawback to this approach is it discourages people from getting tested if they have to pay for it themselves. Then instead of being isolated at NCID they will be in public spreading it around.

The better approach is mentioned by the other redditor: interrogate at airport's outbound area on purpose of travel and deny non-essential travelers. Or, maybe too draconian but enact a law that all non-essential travelers are required to be tested, if positive and warded are legally required to pay hospital bills.

Better to treat them for free than have them avoid treatment and go out spreading the virus around.

Agree

=== Author: naqib94===
I understand the concern regarding non essential travel and whatnot, but I can garuntee like 90% of these imported cases are singaporean students/full time overseas employment who are returning back home because every other country has dropped the ball. Not those people who buy cheap ticket to go holiday.

=== Author: Minister_for_Magic===
>Should stop the aunties and those who insist on travelling

Just interrogate at outbound passport control. If the trip is non-essential, let people know they risk not being let in/having residence status revoked. Anyone traveling internationally now is making bad decisions and should suffer the consequences.

The bulk of cases imported from China were Chinese nationals, except those we evacuated from Wuhan.

Uncontrolled, untraceable spreading plus deaths, hospital overloading would be a DORSCON RED situation. Right now, it's still fairly controlled and quickly traceable, and healthcare services are still fine.

=== Author: DreamyLucid===
Even there are 1000 cases, of which mostly are imported or appearing from the known clusters, it's still going to be Orange as there is no community spread.

Ok first off, assume A has virus, everyone that has been in contact with A, no matter how low the probability is, there is still risk the person will be affected by A and kena virus.

B in your case has the chance of kena virus, but the probability is lowered if it is a short contact (<15min), no direct face to face conversation etc.
It will be further lower if A kept his hygiene, wash his hands, no speaking with friends on phone and spreading saliva n droplets around. Would assume he is not coughing/sneezing being asymptom, or he would wear a mask to reduce the spread.

Having said that, low risk doesn’t mean no risk. B still have chance to kena virus. And he will be difficult case to show up since no history of contact with any case/travel history on the surface.

He will become the 2nd A but hopefully during the asymptom period, B also practice personal hygiene, wash hand and keep social distancing with others, thus lower the number of possible infections vs no precaution at all.

Given the worldwide pandemic spread now, it maybe naive to say to stop the spread. But at least for us still healthy ppl, we can do our part to mitigate or slow down the rate of spreading by looking after our own hygiene and be as social responsible as possible (can’t do much cramping in full loaded bus/mrt though), in order not to collapse the healthcare system with sudden swam of cases.  System cannot survive if we get 1000 cases per day. But it may still be able to sustain if it is spread over the months instead.

> Healthcare systems in these countries seem adequate enough to deal with the virus.

Not true. NHS in the UK is getting overwhelmed. They already can't test people with mild symptoms, instead the ask people to stay at home for 7 days, and only call the 111 hotline if symptoms do not get better.

Situation in the US isn't any better. They seem to have even less testing kits available than UK. Also, many US schools have closed down their dorms, asking students to return home. 

>Are they are trying to get everyone back before the situation worsens and MFA has to expend more resources evacuating citizens?

Possibly. Implementing a high-cost measure now is better than implementing a higher-cost measure a few weeks later.

I'm kind of surprised they are even able to get back home. I'm in Ireland with my Singaporean partner and even if she wanted to go home there's no flights available that will take off.

She's doing her MSc here so not subject to whatever MOE says and she won't go anywhere, but she knows other international students that tried to go home yesterday and were met with canceled flights and no other options so they're stranded. 

This will depend on location though, and where you have to connect through.

If they had a legit reason to be overseas before coming back (eg. Exchange students), I can understand.

The mindset of “oh it won’t happen to me, I can’t be that unlucky” is what will cause more spread. Look at that South Korea cult woman who refused to be tested 3 times because she didn’t travel to China.

Update. Just found out Singapore is doing that soon. Good choice.

But it starts Friday. Why wait? I don't understand why in an emergency or anytime really when a measure is determined necessary it is hardly ever made effective immediately. My own governor, Whitmer when she decided to close schools only made it effective on Monday rather than including the Friday at the end of the week. I get the reasoning of parents needing to adjust but they already need to do this whenever a snow day is called. They don't delay snow days a day so parents can adjust.

I think also a lot of the time a policy takes effect later this is done casually. Policymakers in all countries should adopt a ""* don't put things off if you don't have too"" approach and before making a policy effective later instead of immediately ask what makes a delay is necessary and appropriate. If nothing or if the reason isn't compelling enough then public policy should just be made effective immediately. Why not?

EDIT: * Realized the ""haste makes waste"" quote is the wrong one. The new one isn't quite as proverb-like but I couldn't find a good proverb.

Shutting down businesses is a good measure  for containment, but not sustainable for the long term. If we shut them down now, how long can we afford to keep them closed? Business suffer, people's livelihood get disrupted, govt may need to spend more money to help them tide over. 

It's likely to be used as a measure intermittently, like when there is the admission rate of patients are high, instead of a long term measure like SHN/ contact tracing/ ""reactive"" testing. 

Singapore, like China and Hong Kong, is one of the first few countries that battled COVID-19, and they are already undoing some of their drastic measures that they implemented in the initial phase. Thus, it might be a more meaningful comparison to look at the measures taken by them (which are long term measures) rather than the EU and US. 

\#SGUnited

=== Author: HElovesF1===
Of course, but how can we be sure that the imported cases went directly to the hospitals upon arrival? They may be spreading before they are even symptomatic.

Measures should be preventive, not a knee jerk reaction. If we only start implementing more drastic measures when numbers pick up, isn't that already too late? Of course I'm basing all these off observations from the different countries/cities.  
Look at Italy, they only started locking down when the cases shot up, and look what happened.

=== Author: HElovesF1===
Yeah. Back when we first had cases and the situation improved, I thought we were doing well. That was before Europe and US had any spikes. But as Italy and Iran exploded, I quickly realised how we are taking things way too lightly. 

We just don't have a proper way to deal with this situation, majority of the population rely on the public transport, many can't work from home due to various restrictions, and no one is willing to shut down for the sake of the nations's health.

At this point, there is nothing you can do. If it happens, it happens. If it kicks off in a week, that means that the relevant players have already been infected, and the pneumonia cases will start popping up next week. I hope you’re wrong too, because that means hundreds of people suddenly coming down with pneumonia. That is where I predict DORSCON Red will be declared, and we will go into lockdown. 

However quickly the virus spreads, I think it is a good indicator that there are relatively few unlinked cases admitted to the hospital. If widespread community transmission occurs, this number will start increasing exponentially. I am using this as the indicator of whether to be concerned or not. 

Most important is, if you feel unsafe, just stay home. You don’t need to wait for the government to force you to do it, especially if you have some high stakes situations (elderly family members). Try to negotiate Work From Home with your employer. If you go out, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face. This can minimise the chances of you getting COVID, and passing it on to your loved ones.

=== Author: tehtf===
Is not “not taking things seriously”. But that is the plan. To let those mild symptoms take MC and self isolate *hopefully* while treating critical patients first.  Letting ppl know they have been in contact with cases helps to alert them and let them treat and monitor their health more seriously

If you ignite all the bombs together Singapore healthcare going go bye bye.

To be pessimistic, last night JB causeway rush maybe another cluster to be frank.

Just hope that the ppl coming here did their best to self protect, and keep their distancing and isolation when feeling ill, since they have been receiving SG news and advices for the past few months while working here.

I concur. The moment the above signs happen, that will surely signal DORSCON RED.

Since most of them are imported cases and presumably found at the airport, there's still a fair chance that it will not have a wide spread to the community yet.

I see people spitting, coughing and sneezing in public openly without a mask all the time and even in hospital, I see staff not wearing their masks properly.

Of course one might argue, they aren't handling covid patients but can you imagine, what will happen if one of them get it from a patient seeking medical attention for other problems. Off topic but just to show many people aren't responsible.

Thank you! SG is not testing enough. Other countries explicitly state the number of tests performed. Can’t find that info for SG. How many tests has SG actually done?

My own guess about Sg not doing aggressive testing but discretionary testing might also have to do with our testing capacity (how many testing kits and testing facilities we have, our rate of producing the kits), that I can’t find info about.

And it might follow the same argument as the face mask- we have limited supply so we use it wherever it’s most needed and ration the rest for a sustained, long term fight against covid19.

=== Author: Ours_Polare===
The difference is by the time the US knows that there is widespread community transmission, it is already too late. This is due to them NOT TESTING their patients in order to keep their numbers down. 

Singapore keeps up with relatively rigorous testing. My estimate is that this testing is enough to know within 5 days if widespread community transmission occurs. By then, the government will start implementing work from home, and possible lockdown. But I am assured that they definitely have a plan in this direction, since this is one of the more likely scenarios.

""govt may need to spend more money to help them tide over""

Actually this is the point of having a huge reserve isn't it? Being one of the largest in the world, we shouldn't even hesitate to spend if the situation arises. I mean the German govt is guaranteeing ALL bank loan facilities for their local businesses to help tide through this tough period. But this is starting to tip into politics, which is not the point of this thread. 

We might be one of the first, because we are so interconnected with the rest of the world. Plus being a small country, detections will be much earlier than US/EU. 

Further, I believe the number of new cases in China is even lower than ours now, so we are at a totally different stage. The worst has probably passed for China, SK, HK. We are only starting to see a spike in new cases the past week. I think the days ahead will be dark(hopefully I'm proven wrong).

I am actually at low risk because I work night shift so I don't come into contact with large crowds most of the time.

The problem I have with what the govt is doing is that they keep emphasizing ""imported"" as if there is nothing to worry about within the local population. A lot of elderly will buy into this and just live their lives naturally.

There has been a lot of reports that COVID19 can spread while the carrier is not symptomatic and even more alarmingly reports that some carriers remain unsymptomatic throughout their infection period. By the time people start coming down with pneumonia all over the country, you know it's already too late.

The problem is that for most people COVID19 is harmless. This is the problem because it's those who have it and aren't gravely sick that will be doing the spreading of the virus. This is why it's important to test proactively to identify all possible cases of the virus and isolate them.

=== Author: woohwaah===
Those coming from JB work in SG and spend most of their time in SG, what makes you think if they carry the virus it's from Malaysia and not SG ?

The plan is to let those  who have mild symptoms self isolate and treat serious cases ? Aren't you putting too much trust in people ? Isn't all this all too passive, wait and see ?

I may be wrong, but I don't think DORSCON Orange has put any sort of bans on gatherings above x number of people ? Just ""advisories"". People are still gathering and for the most part living normally, only those who choose to live differently are living differently.

I am not saying make everyone panic by implementing crazy measures. I am just saying the govt needs to be more aggressive in  proactive testing. 

I personally know someone under quarantine now (Not SHN). He is a HSE personnel working directly with someone who tested positive for COVID19. Govt response was to Quarantine him (Without testing him) and sent 2 workers working with the HSE personnel to home quarantine. They live in a dorm with 10 other people. None of them were tested. Does this seem like adequate measures to prevent local outbreaks ? For me, absolutely not.

=== Author: Pandacius===
Yes, but I fear the response is a still a little late. The virus has has up to 14 days to show symptoms, and people take about 3-7 days after that to be diagnosed. During this time, the number of cases in the west to growing exponentially. Expected to see yesterdays numbers - or higher for at the east the next 2 weeks. That is scary.

Singapore was one of the first with China ban. But China forced all visitors to stay at home 2 weeks before us. By then time we've gone lockdown, most European cities and several other states did so already. This was reactvie rather than proactive, and thats bad with the virus.

I hope you do know that the strength of our currency is tied quite closely to how much we have in our reserves. I do want to agree that in the case of a severe downturn, tapping into reserves may be needed, but we shouldn't be too dependent on it. A quick check on the statistics: Official Reserves are at about 395bn, Total Exports for 2019 are at about $532bn. We don't even have enough to cover exports, let alone domestic consumption and investments.

>Thus, it might be a more meaningful comparison to look at the measures taken by them (which are long term measures) rather than the EU and US.

To clarify, I mean Sg is similar to China, SK, HK that we have been actively dealing with COVID-19 since late Jan/ early Feb, unlike US/EU which started to take things  more seriously at late Feb.

Thus, I believe our govt has more ""experience"" and measures already in place. 

We probably do not need to adopt a ""shut down"" measure now, which probably is to use to buy time to come up with other measures (which we already have) and trace large number of  unlinked cases/clusters.

=== Author: Ours_Polare===
In my opinion, the government is emphasising imported because the cases *are* imported. They aren’t saying there’s nothing to worry about locally, but imagine saying there’s 47 new cases without clarifying in the headlines. That exponential growth would be an indication of widespread community transmission. And you know that most people don’t read past the headlines. 

Imagine the run on items the past few days, and then x3. That’s what will happen if they simply say “47 new cases”, and only clarify in the body text. 

By the time people start coming down with pneumonia all over the country, it is not too late. An immediate lockdown will still result in minimal spreading. If you’re saying that there is “widespread community transmission”, I’ll assume that there must be around 200 cases at once. Since 20% of the cases are severe, this means 40 people suddenly coming down with pneumonia at around the same time period. With an R0 of 3, that will become 120 soon after. This will be extremely noticeable. Locking down at that point in time will see maybe 1000 infected. This means 200 severe cases, spread out over a small time period. That’s how bad I believe it will get. But I don’t want the government to use up all their testing kits, and then stand there look pretty like the US government while the outbreak cannot be at all controlled anymore. Our greatest strength is extensive contact tracing, but that’s only provided we have enough tests. With how things are going right now, we might find that this may not be true if we test so extensively.

=== Author: tehtf===
For your friend, is he showing any symptoms? If he is not, what are the chances he will be tested +ve instead of -ve if there is no enough virus accumulated to show yet? If he tested -ve, is he going to be re-test everyday for 14 days to be safe?

The 2 workers are like secondary contacts already, actually I quite puzzle why they under go quarantine too. Unless the workers are also in direct contact with the Case like your friend. If it is QO issued, there should be QO officer accessing the dorm to see if it is suitable for quarantine. If not, will put you in the gov quarantine facility for the 14 days QO.


Ok, regarding the testing criteria, when the procedures are make, Test kits are a scarcity. Now there maybe cheaper and faster alternatives to be used for more pro-active testing, i don’t know at my level, so what you suggest for pro-testing may still be executable now or in future. Though we still need to consider if healthcare system are able to take the additional load now with the incoming surge of imported cases as citizens coming back.

Definitely. A lockdown is a crucial part of the policy arsenal. It is basically the nuclear button - the last resort if the virus spreads faster than their containment measures. 

So many countries have done the lockdown already, that they should know what are the possible issues that need to be addressed.

There is no real permanent leadership in place to make decisions. In some cases Trump even installed his own personal ""aide"" to keep an eye on the acting department heads.

The quarantine criteria is “ppl with close contact with confirm case”, where close contact definition is close distance (<2m) with long period exposure (think >30min, though also saw some country’s definition is>20min). Don’t care you well or not well, slap you with QO first if you fulfill the criteria. Though if you unwell+ close contact you would be call ambulance and send for testing n isolation...

Though to answer your suggestion of testing every close contact, If sg is going to tes each and every close contact of every confirm case, I don’t know if the lab can tahan or not...

Though your friend’s other colleagues kena SHN is quite new to me. I would have thought they will just be under phone surveillance given that they are not consider close contact to the case. Maybe MOH stepped up the measure and become more prudent hence given out SHN instead of just phone surveillance.
Or the workers just return overseas?

I think the fundamental difference between our argument is that you point of view is that ppl should be tested if they are in contact with cases to clear themselves instead of still staying in wild/even if they undergo QO/SHN, while my POV is testing should only be done when they start showing symptoms. before that they are consider clear, just higher risk than normal ppl who are not in contact with any cases *to their knowledge*

Ok, super controversial opinion, but China didn’t handle it that badly. Yes they hid the number of cases, but basically every country is doing that right now. Even worse, they’re doing that after condemning China for the exact same problem. When it comes to saving face, most countries except the Europeans will try their best to minimise their “weakness”. 

When it was evident that it became serious, they took swift and immediate measures. Sure, a complete lockdown probably wasn’t a good idea. But bear in mind at that time, the virus was still an unknown entity. It could be some pneumonia symptoms, or it could be something way worse. No one knew how it spreads, how fast it spreads, and its mortality rate. In that situation, a lockdown seems appropriate. They did not handle the lockdown as well as I had hoped, but it was during the Chinese New Year period. Imagine having to recall and coordinate all the police officers who went home to see their families, while trying to stop others from doing the same thing. 

After that, they learnt from their mistake and started to do contact tracing and testing in other regions instead of a mass lockdown. This allowed for the government to also understand what’s going on on the ground and properly address the issues, instead of completely isolating a region. Meanwhile, in Wuhan, food was still being delivered regularly. Mask production still continued in other parts of China. 

Yes they should’ve cracked down on the wet markets, and it did increase the chances of animal to human cross-species transmission. But this pandemic was just a matter of time. Bill Gates addressed this in a Ted Talk before, where he predicted a pandemic such as this occurring, and overloading all our health systems. If not in China, it would have happened somewhere else. That’s no excuse for the Chinese government to not have learnt from its mistakes from SARS, but I believe that universal condemnation is a little too extreme. That’s just how nature is - viruses will come and go.

Tedros was very clear in saying it was a serious global problem.  I watched all the WHO press briefings livestreamed day after day, and Tedros was like a broken record nagging western countries about the need to take things seriously.  


Problem is, the US really wanted to hear the word ""pandemic"".    
Tedros was essentially saying, for weeks, ""guys this WILL BECOME a pandemic if you don't take things seriously"".  The US was waiting for Tedros to say ""this is a pandemic"" for them to take things seriously.  


Singapore took China seriously, and Singapore took Tedros seriously.  Singapore stepped up and has been proactive since the beginning.  The US seems to lack mature listening comprehension.  Like they only want to hear a tldr of 1 keyword, if not they just don't bother.

This. Best logical response I've seen in some time.

Nowadays, US, and especially the Trump Administration, is trying to smear China, saying how it cost the world 2 months from its hiding of the virus, how it silenced its whistleblowers (this is true), continue calling it The Wuhan virus or China virus and so on...

While Trump himself kept dismissing claims from USA's own national experts that the virus is already spreading in the USA, until a few days ago, and yesterday, he even claimed he knew it was a pandemic before it was a pandemic. By the way, this is not mentioning the CDC test failures and so on, which is just ridiculous.

>WASHINGTON — For weeks, President Trump has minimized the coronavirus, mocked concern about it and treated the risk from it cavalierly. On Tuesday he took to the White House lectern and made a remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along.

>“This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”

>“No, I’ve always viewed it as very serious,” Mr. Trump said. “There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t.”

At the end of the day, governments will have to answer to their citizens, no matter if it's a constitutional democracy or communist country. 

At the beginning of the crisis when Hubei Province is affected, it was clear that the unaffected countries, especially the western nations, took it lightly, with some the likes of US even brushing it off as a 'common flu'. 

Now that they are experiencing what China faced, we all can see just how impressive China was, but it is certainly not something all countries could have done. Oppressive tactics were surely at play, as well as widespread surveillance. But they could have prepared much earlier, and this is the cause of the crisis the world faces today.

Surprisingly, still not much is known since the start of the outbreak, about the confirmed modes of transmissions, what are the best tests for the virus (the current nose and throat swab has quite a low accuracy, since some patients had to see a doctor a few times before being diagnosed, it has quite a number of false negatives too, causing still infected patients to be discharged) and so on.

china did a good job after their first 2 months of covering up. but they did fuck up the rest of the world by saying its not human to human, and not to ban flights from china. maybe because it disadvantaged them so better spread it worldwide relatively speaking. i mean i do give some leeway because first 2-3 weeks you cant really tell how bad the transmission is but it looks like a big coverup

=== Author: confused_cereal===
So have I, and my take is that Tedros and the WHO were very much effete from the beginning. 

For example, late Jan it was still [arguing against](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/31/as-far-right-calls-for-china-travel-ban-health-experts-warn-coronavirus-response-would-suffer/) closing borders or travel restrictions, which is a major step in the containment phase. The US did it anyway, and Singapore soon after (though I wouldn't go so far to suggest causality) along with parts of East Asia. 

Of course, subsequent US (in)-action is a joke. Turns out travel bans are the easy part of the solution--- not just in implementation but also in terms of raking in political points.

But not calling out WHO for its incompetence or lackadaisical attitudes is disingenuous at best.

Ebola? You missed how Obama handled H1N1 (hint: poorly). Heck, he took action 4 months after WHO declared it a pandemic and a thousand US citizens had already died. By the end, more than 10,000 US citizens died.

And the US media carried his balls and said he did a great job even as he went golfing and told everybody to relax. It's amazing how a change in presidents can make the media change its tune so easily.
https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/politics/02crisis.html?searchResultPosition=26

Well, I should be fairer towards Obama's staffers. They probably advised him correctly and were promptly ignored. After all, he was often quoted as being so confident that he declared he could do the job of any of his subordinates better than they could do it themselves.

As for the free market... well, harnessing the power of private sector resources is the way to go. The state can coordinate and support, but the ground action should be free from bureaucratic harassment, which is what happened in the US. Did you even read the article, or the original NYT one?

=== Author: The_Wobbly_Guy===
Oh, btw, just from checking online sources - ebola affected less than 10 people in the US, so it was a non-issue for them, and the feds didn't even have to take any real action other than offering aid to affected countries.

Every national leader will always seek to instil calm and insist they are in control (even when, or especially when, they're not). You expect them to go around screaming about the crisis? That's not going to help.

I also did say Trump's admin essentially wasted the safety margin bought by his decision to restrict travel. And who second-guessed his decision back then?

China did say transmission was human-to-human by early-mid January.  Look, the US has no excuse.  Stop blaming China.  Singapore got the message the same time as the US.  What has Singapore done in response, and what has the US done in response?  The results speak for themselves.      
And the US is a huge country with vast resources - much more so than Singapore.  This is a matter of effort, not about what time you got the homework assignment (because everyone got it at the same time).

H1N1 literally is the flu, which kills about 35,000 people annually in the US. The fatality rate of seasonal flu is about 5 times that of that particular strain of H1N1.

This looks like the timeline for the administration's H1N1 response:

> The agency said the first case was reported on April 15, 2009, and the government declared H1N1 a public health emergency on the April 26. The first test to detect the new virus was approved by the FDA two days later. Shipments of the new CDC test began May 1.

All way before the first death even occurred. They also pushed for vaccine development and got vaccines out in months (which was much easier of course because flu vaccines already exist, that can't be compared to COVID-19). What would you expect the Obama administration to have done better?

> Well, I should be fairer towards Obama's staffers. They probably advised him correctly and were promptly ignored. After all, he was often quoted as being so confident that he declared he could do the job of any of his subordinates better than they could do it themselves.

Maybe because his staffers felt it was true too. [What Was It Like to Be Edited by Barack Obama?](https://lithub.com/what-was-it-like-to-be-edited-by-barack-obama/)

> As for the free market... well, harnessing the power of private sector resources is the way to go. The state can coordinate and support, but the ground action should be free from bureaucratic harassment, which is what happened in the US. Did you even read the article, or the original NYT one?

I'll let you take this one - I read rapid deregulation as massive deregulation, which would be wrong, but rapid is right. It's still incumbent on the FDA and CDC to take the lead to lead what is a national and global crisis, but they did need to get rid of red tape quickly - but with a scalpel, not a cleaver. I'll point back to the President's responsibility to ensure that the respective agencies are all playing ball rather than being engaged in infighting.

It's exactly that one. The numbers were low because actions were taken quickly, and it's nice to be able to say later on ""was this a nothingburger?"". Yet, people at the time were panicking about an Ebola epidemic *in the United States*. 

[This clip here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0NhA4oBGuc) shows how seriously Fox News was taking the Ebola crisis, especially when compared to how seriously they were taking COVID-19.

The thing is, if it is objectively done, yes US should chastise China for its initial poor handling of the virus.

But the way Trump is doing it, it seems obvious that he is trying to make China a focus to distract his poor handling of the situation in USA. Fun fact, China's population size is more than 4 times the size of USA.

Hey man i dont give usa points for anything. They are fucking up just by themselves. Are you some kind of ccp troll?

The serious fuckup in china that they were still denying human to human till aroubd 20 jan, blocking WHO experts from getting into epicenter. Think they didnt even let them into wuhan, and complaining that the world was blocking flights. Even today the official number is 21 new cases for whole of china. A few countries just totally disregard all china data like tw and ban the masks from being shipped there. And hk pressured their healthcare service to close the border. Sg had direct flights to wuhan and we did it pretty fast too.

=== Author: zyrapenguin===
Not a CCP troll (lol), but I have been following the situation closely since January (including, like I mentioned, keeping track of the detailed WHO updates daily in their briefings).  

The WHO was let into Wuhan (the epicentre) - you can refer to the official report authored by the WHO team that visited (which was released quite some time ago), as well as Dr Bruce Aylward's lengthy press briefing and update on the situation following the WHO trip to China (including the epicentre).  This is all very well-documented (after all, it's the WHO), and the reports are easily found online.

Not sure why you think WHO was not even let into Wuhan - have you been getting all your news from US news sources?  ;)

China's numbers for *recent* new cases has been widely acknowledged (by the WHO, by numerous  authorities including the Singapore government, by Chinese healthcare staff on the ground) as being credible.  Their initial numbers at the start of the outbreak were of course inaccurate - some of this was due to the local Wuhan government's coverup, and later (mid to late January) mostly a result of test capacity: insufficient test kits and not enough healthcare personnel to carry out testing at a pace that would reflect actual numbers.  (Which is the same situation you now see playing out across the rest of the world - many countries having vastly underreported initial numbers because their testing capacities cannot keep up with the sheer number of actual cases out there.)

China's new numbers also make sense from an epidemiological standpoint, because it is to be expected that with strict, drastic (some say draconian) measures such as their lockdowns, quarantines etc - clusters will be contained and will burn themselves out.  Most epidemiologists and those with a background in public health would look at China's current data and say that it is consistent with the measures they've implemented over the past 2 months.  The people that are still crying foul on China's recent case numbers tend to be people without a public health background and with a political agenda.

You obviously agree that the major Asian hubs I mentioned took action (Taiwan, HK, Singapore, etc).  They saw China's lockdown, believed the severity of the situation, listened to the WHO's constant entreaties to take the epidemic seriously.  My point is that the US has no leg to stand on if it tries to blame China for its current predicament, because there is much more it could have done if it did not engage in racist/nationalist victim-blaming and political grandstanding.  Countries such as Singapore are examples of those who saw China's situation, listened to what the China and the WHO were saying about the virus and the measures needed to contain it, and took action (to their benefit).  We from Singapore did not luck into our current position.  We are doing relatively well so far, and that is because we made the effort to act.  We heeded the warning in January.  Unlike, sadly, the USA and Europe.

=== Author: wiltedpop===
as said, i dont really care about the USA response, so why keep bringing them up?  i know they are fucking up on their own, being asleep at the wheel. my issue was this, article says WHO experts reach wuhan epicenter Feb 17-Feb 18, maybe it is another batch, but that is nearly 3 weeks after they confirm human to human. 

[https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/24/who-experts-visit-chinese-virus-epicenter.html](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/24/who-experts-visit-chinese-virus-epicenter.html)

I am blaming China for their first 2 months cover up, they detain their own doctors who spread it via text message, and complained that countries should not ban travel to/from china, which is quite damaging to the rest of world even one week more of china travellers running all over = multiple epicenters.This period is from December to end-January, they seem to be preventing taiwan from getting WHO data even today. As said, if TW believed all this BS they would have 1000++ cases now, but luckily TW is very alert against CCP and blocked all China travel very early on.

virus can come from anywhere, even SG has wet markets. as to their TCM wildlife trade, it has to stop and i think they're really gonna clamp down hard this time, or else we'll get another round. We should be sharing data with TW/HK/SK those who successfully play defence, as well as look at the italian data and make sure we have mitigation steps if it gets to that stage.

=== Author: zyrapenguin===
Read the immediate parent thread above - this discussion pertains to what the USA and its leaders have been doing.  If you don't like that, make your comments in another thread.

Since you would rather read the Jakarta Post (lol - the same Jakarta Post that accused Singapore of not sharing information on cases) than the WHO reports I referred you to, here is a link to spoonfeed you: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf

It takes time and diplomacy to assemble and approve an official WHO team to visit an outbreak epicenter for an official report (such as the one I linked).  Members of the epidemic-specific investigative team from WHO were carefully selected and vetted, based on their individual experience, countries of expertise, and type of skills they would bring to the team. After the selection process, they then had to be additionally vetted and approved by their home countries as well as China, and cleared to visit high-risk areas (i.e. places where the virus was rampant) that were technically already on strict governmental lockdown.  Note also that the WHO already had regular WHO staff in China (i.e. in the WHO China branches, in main Chinese cities) from the beginning.  There was never any point in time in which there was zero WHO presence in China during this outbreak.  

The international team that carried out the Feb 16-24 investigation was comprised of experts from all over the world (including a Singapore 
expert).  Taiwan has had access to WHO data one way or another, even though it is not ""formally acknowledged"" as a country.  This is how things work diplomatically and internationally - just because a country is not a WHO member does not mean it will not receive the data through unofficial, unacknowledged means.  Note also that travel bans are a two-way process in that if one country is on lockdown, the flow of travelers is automatically reduced regardless of whether the other country implements bans.  For example, Malaysia is now on lockdown - and so a Singapore travel ban against Malaysia would not currently make a sizeable difference to the influx of Malaysians to Singapore.  That said, China has banned solo travel to Taiwan since mid-2019 (you can easily check this through multiple news sources).  In effect, any bans coming from Taiwan in 2020 have had a negligible influence on pre-existing travel flow.

>*""virus can come from anywhere, even SG has wet markets. as to their TCM wildlife trade, it has to stop and i think they're really gonna clamp down hard this time, or else we'll get another round. We should be sharing data with TW/HK/SK those who successfully play defence, as well as look at the italian data and make sure we have mitigation steps if it gets to that stage.""*

I have no idea why you went off on an unrelated tangent regarding TCM wildlife trade and sharing data, as these points are unrelated to the original discussion.  Data-sharing between countries is a given, and has taken place since January - every country has sent data through international channels (the WHO has a formal process for collating data from all countries and making sure it is shared).  Singapore has followed all WHO-recommended international procedures for data-sharing, and was even commended by the WHO as a country that has been quick and prompt to fill and submit the WHO forms/reports to facilitate this sharing.
In a pandemic, data-sharing is centralized by the WHO, and is not on the informal level (i.e. not subject to country-to-country agreements) you imply it is.

I strongly suggest reading up on international crisis response procedures and protocols, especially WHO-affiliated reports and those authored by experts with a background in public health and epidemiology.  Pandemic management involves both public health expertise as well as diplomacy management - there are standard ways in which this plays out during an epidemic/pandemic.  If you are really interested in learning more about pandemic crisis management, I suggest you look to (for starters) WHO publications as well as peer-reviewed publications in well-established academic journals.

their spokesman was telling people not to travel ban china around feb 1, 10 days after experts said that it had gone human to human. and during that time there are about 15000 official cases in China

Jan 3. Dr Li Wen Liang gets summoned for spreading ""rumours"" to his doctor colleages about suspected SARS looking disease.

So lets take it that this whistleblower dont exist, and they only detect it on Feb 3 (1 month lag time), why are they telling people not to travel ban and that its not dangerous? i mean they have one fucking month to see the effects on their own city

This is WHO president Tedros:""The chance of getting this (virus) going to anywhere outside China is very low, and even in China when you go to other provinces, it's very low,"" he added.

=== Author: zyrapenguin===
Read what I wrote about travel bans and how they work.  If you lack reading comprehension, there's no point in continuing this discussion, especially when you continue to throw out random irrelevant points/quotes unrelated to the arguments at hand.  If you do not understand the ways in which basic diplomacy and public health measures work, re-read my recommendations on how you may educate yourself with reliable sources.  


To your random quote from Tedros: What Tedros said was true \*at that time given the information they had on hand\*.  And the virus' relatively low spread to the majority of other Chinese provinces remains a fact, when you look at the data on a city-by-city, province-by-province basis.  Outside the epicenter, other Chinese provinces have had relatively low numbers of cases.  In fact, during the early phases of the epidemic (now pandemic) around early-mid February, Singapore had more cases than most other Chinese cities (Singapore was ranked among the top 10 cities - \*including\* all Chinese cities - for confirmed cases).  The virus could have been contained to a much greater extent had \*all\* countries treated the situation seriously as Singapore (and the other major Asian hubs).  Tedros was not wrong in saying that the virus had the potential to be contained and mitigated - however, this containment and mitigation hinged on the cooperation of all countries around the world, and very few countries outside Asia complied with the WHO's recommendations.  For example, if someone assigns you a project and says it is doable - after which you fail to take any steps to research the project and execute on it - it makes very little sense for you to then come complaining that the project is not doable and that the teacher/supervisor assigned an impractical/unrealistic project.  Containment and mitigation was indeed possible, especially at the time Tedros made that statement.  But many countries failed to act.  Singapore government ministers have also acknowledged this point - of the way other countries' inaction have impacted the outcome, despite Singapore's best individual efforts - in interviews.  


I reiterate: if you don't understand why countries or international organizations act the way they do, or why epidemiologists make certain recommendations or forecasts, study reliable sources and academic journals.  The field of public health and the field of international studies interact in very interesting ways during a pandemic, and if you are sincerely interested in learning more instead of asking kneejerk rhetorical questions based on skimmed news articles, there are many ways you can actually educate yourself during this time.  (Especially when many academic - particularly public health-related - journals are now free for the general public to access, specifically during this time.  Normally they charge exorbitant access fees to those not affiliated with research/educational institutions - but they have recently waived those fees for the general public due to the pandemic.)

i read your article. tedros statement was irresponsible, and it comes from ST, [https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-china-to-allow-in-us-health-experts-as-virus-shows-no-sign-of-slowing](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-china-to-allow-in-us-health-experts-as-virus-shows-no-sign-of-slowing) on Feb 4. Likewise the chinese spokesman critisizing travel ban was also irresponsible given that theres a huge outbreak in Wuhan, and that they did not successfully contain Wuhan residents from spreading across China and they know it, and likewise any country without a flight travel ban was gonna get hit hard. we had direct flights to wuhan daily, and thanks to the travel ban we have much less cases.

Iran continued regular flights to wuhan for 3 weeks after we did till Feb 25. Look at what happened to them.

>i read your article. 

Very amusing.  What ""article"" are you referring to?  Because the direct link I did mention was an official report by an international organization put together by a team of public health officials, not an article.  
Nowhere did I dispute the source of Tedros' statement, or that he made that statement.  At this point, you do not actually seem to comprehend the basic points and reasoning in all I've laid out, on a fundamental level.
Last word on travel bans (will not be engaging in this discussion further as you have not demonstrated any effort to thoroughly read or understand - either that or you have made effort but unfortunately lack the ability to process and understand what you read): the US and Italy were some of the first countries to announce travel bans against China.  Italy's travel ban on Jan 31 came well before Singapore's travel ban (February 8).  In your world where absolute travel bans take precedence in determining outcomes, I'm sure Italy is doing very well now as a result of its early travel ban.  In fact, according to your expert reasoning, it's clear that Italy's prescient travel bans are the reason why Italy has so many fewer cases than Singapore now ;)

It appears you lack basic reading comprehension, and are not actually grasping what is being said - not just in this exchange, but in what you actually read (or claim you read).  This is very unfortunate, but I don't think I can assist you any further.  

I'll leave you with a few last ""articles"" (lol) to read, if you actually do want to learn more:

Your data isnt accurate. Singapores direct ban on flights on wuhan is feb 1. Italy ban was 1 day earlier. I cant say for certain why italy is so badly hit but it appears they had an asymptomatic super spreader who came in before the travel bans and spread it for weeks undetected. Maybe its just their bad luck.


I am saying tedros statement and the chinese spokesman statement was irresponsible and distorted the clear risk of transmission. You can write an entire essay on what ""article"" means but its still beating around the bush.

> # NUS students allegedly abuse Covid-19 measures to cheat on exam

> To protect students from the coronavirus, the National University of Singapore (NUS) allowed them take a practical examination at home.

> But despite being warned not to cheat, a significant number allegedly shared their answers and plagiarised each other.

> NUS is now scrutinising their submissions and identifying the alleged cheaters so action can be taken against them.

> Replying to queries from The New Paper, a spokesman for the NUS School of Computing confirmed it is investigating, with instructors still making plagiarism checks and have yet to finalise the results.

> ""NUS takes a serious view of academic dishonesty and does not condone plagiarism,"" she said.

> TNP understands Mr Prabawa Adi Yoga Sidi, the lecturer teaching the module, sent out an e-mail about a week ago urging students who had cheated to confess.

> It is believed that several have come forward and admitted to plagiarism.

> The exam is worth 15 per cent of the final grade for the programming methodology module, which is compulsory for engineering students.

> The module, also known as CS1010E, is described as an introduction to fundamental concepts of problem solving, involving the use of computing and programming in the Python programming language.

> The spokesman said about 680 students are taking the module in the current semester.

> CLASS SETTING

> The exam is usually held in a class setting, but in light of Covid-19, Mr Prabawa allowed it to be taken at home earlier this month.

> Students had to log in at the same time to work independently on three tasks, comprising seven questions, and submit their answers online.

> The spokesman said students were reminded that there would be plagiarism checks and penalties if they were caught.

> According to NUS policies, students who plagiarise or aid and abet such actions may be subject to disciplinary action.

> ""In addition, the student may receive a reduced grade, possibly even a zero mark, for the relevant academic assignment, project or thesis, and could receive a failed grade for the module,"" said the spokesman.

> ""Any student caught plagiarising will be required to retain the plagiarised module as graded.""

> Numerous posts on Facebook page NUSWhispers in the past week claimed to be from students taking the module.

> Some claimed they had cheated because the conditions were difficult and it was to be expected, while others said they had learnt their lesson.

> One post, addressed to Mr Prabawa, claimed that if disciplinary action was taken, it would be the school's fault that ""almost half"" of the students would be severely affected and face problems with graduation and finding jobs.

> Another post said students were ""begging for mercy"", as the plagiarism checks are ""almost a death sentence"".

> Commenting on one of the posts, Mr Prabawa said the instructors were able to measure similarities in submissions and identify possible collaborations within groups, and this will be investigated further.

> ""Plagiarism is not a victimless crime. The students who are not plagiarising are being victimised. So we need to protect the victims,"" he said.

> The spokesman said: ""The school is aware of the diverse views raised by students.""

> She said that instructors will address their concerns and plan to conduct optional remedial sessions to help those who had difficulties with the module.

it is difficult because it is taught in the wrong order.

if the students learned digital logic, assembly programming first before transitioning to computer languages they would have had an easier time.

but because they jumped straight into the abstract language without understanding the fundamentals, they tend to equate computer language with human languages like english, which is when they run into big problems when they make the same assumptions.

In a coding work environment, copying bits and pieces from the internet and modifying them to suit your problem to write a long piece of code is normal practice. 

At the end, most code is different combinations of the same basic building blocks of functions. It is rare to find a completely novel piece of code. 

That is the problem with coding exams, because irl work you are copying a lot, suddenly you go into the exam and you can't copy. 

Doesn't help that coding usually has no bell curve so you will fail if you don't produce a solution.

Yeah from NTU's equivalent mod, programming can be quite abstract and hard to grasp for beginners. NUS's mod looks even deeper - data structures, recursion, order of growth, sorting were part of a separate mod in NTU.

Disagree with this. You don't need to understand digital logic and assembly before learning to program. The concepts they teach in a mod like this (basic flow control, recursion, basic OOP) does not require any of such knowledge at all.

‘Sai kang’ is very different from a bad syllabus. 

A bad syllabus teaches students outdated/wrong information, or may not be structured in a manner that is practical. The student might not be able to cope well because of the lack of proper revision materials or lab practice. Think of say, a web technology module teaching deprecated technologies. The documentation is outdated and the students are no longer able to run the code the professor provides because the technology is a security risk. It makes the redundant learning an absolute pain, but may still have a chance at being meaningful to a certain extent. 

‘Sai kang’ is just menial labor.

EDIT: Also I’d like to point out that the fact that apparently half the cohort cheated just shows so much about the students.

so it boils down to what is being tested and how it is graded.

why would a test require you to google anyway? a sketch of the solution featuring steps required to sufficient detail should suffice. It's the approach not detail that matters.

I don't think so. After 1010E I took up a CS minor and took their 2k mods and I can tell you their difficulty scale-up from 1k to 2k is pretty standard.   


They shouldn't make it easier because it'll give people the wrong impression that they can code well when they actually couldn't.

I disagree. The difficulty is the transition, not the content itself. What you need is a better teaching plan to transition students to get into programmatic thinking, not easier questions.

If you cannot manage a 1k module at its peak, you have no business taking 2k, 3k or even 4k modules.

no. digital logic -> state machines -> general purpose cpu design->assembly programming-> compilers -> high level programming it is quite well linked and is foundational. it is not quite necessary to go down into the transistor level, but good to know how it is implemented physically.

Please don't try this ad-hominem stuff on me with your ""disagree but have no other ideas"" insinuation.

Have you taken NUS SoC programming mods? It's not that these students have issues with programming or that programming is difficult. You can go to those govt-subsidised Python bootcamps and press play on jupyter notebook cells and learning programming is all fun and easy. Except that in SoC, the mods are designed to be difficult and stretch your understanding of core topics like recursion.

They teach you the basics and first principles via lectures, and then give you many assignments/tests that really challenge your understanding of these first principles. That's how we learn here. The tests are meant to be difficult.

The issue here is simply the portion of Engineering students having integrity issues and a lack of tenacity. The mod can be hard and all, but they didn't have to resort to plagiarism. Some of them also can't be half-arsed to properly learn this mod because it's ""just a graduation requirement"" to them, since they are not computing majors.

A better question for you to ask is, does CS1010E need to be as rigorous as it currently is (it actually really isn't as difficult as the other CS1101S/CS1010* modules) for engineering students? You could argue that in some ways, it being so rigorous ""caused the students to cheat"", but even for this line of argument, the fault is clearly on the students.

=== Author: archchroot===
Also, they are learning python here, not C++/C or doing some disassembly, where knowledge of digital logic and assembly might be useful. I don't really see why these are ""fundamentals"". In fact, as engineering students, they'd definitely have taken modules which teaches them about digital logic.

=== Author: ylyn===
This is ridiculous.

High-level programming languages are designed to abstract away details like hardware architecture, memory management, etc etc, so people can focus on the _logic_ of the program.

As I've told my students in the past, don't break the abstractions given to you. Trust that they work as described and implement your programs on top of them. As you know, high-level languages are one such abstraction.

When you are familiar enough with what the abstractions do and you want to know _how_ they work, then you delve in deeper.

No one starts off teaching primary school kids the Peano axioms before teaching them basic arithmetic. Same goes here.

Your logic is akin to asking a kid to learn to run before he learns how to walk.. it’s true that assembly is the foundation for higher level. But this only applies when you have a solid ground on high level and is working to improve your foundations and understanding further. Without basic level of understanding of logic in higher level of programming and more importantly practice you really wouldn’t make it through assembly

I think your approach might work for a handful, but probably not all.

Another way of putting your argument into perspective:  [https://xkcd.com/435/](https://xkcd.com/435/)

The gap between low level programming & high level programming is so large that starting high level actually helps a lot more.

I wouldn't want to go into compilers without knowing data structures (abstract syntax trees to be specific).

have you ever taught in academia?

the primary reason for the level of difficulty (especially in singapore) is to sort the students into a normal distribution so that you can stream them.  


If all the smart people go into computing because of fad - of course, difficulty will go up.

It's not difficult for us teachers to set difficult questions for students. We have years to hone tricks students have to overcome in a semester. Whether such tricks are used in industry? that would be a big no if they can help it.

But if the problem is that good students are not doing well, that suggests a foundational gap.

=== Author: _TzzzK===
CS1010E is a module engineering students take very early on. I took it in my first semester alongside calculus, physics fundamentals and a general education module, so students haven't had a chance to learn any digital logic yet (at least in university). Even though I did reasonably well in this module, I can see why many find it very difficult to understand it because the way of thinking is simply to different from what most are used to.

=== Author: tentacle_===
that is the problem. because you know how it's done internally. put yourself in the shoes to those who do not know and I hope you can realise what their difficulty is.

Lol.

Take the statement: I am happier if I score higher marks.

The typical human has an easier time understanding

    if score > 90, happy += 1

As opposed to verbose assembly like

    cmp [ebp-8], 90
    jle _somewhere
    inc [ebp-8]

It's not about whether asm is easier or not. It's whether which language is an easier transition from human languages, and nobody sane would consider asm easier. You can argue asm gives more control and room to optimise stuff, but that is more advanced stuff.

=== Author: WittyKap0===
We had to code in a custom assembly instruction set for the equivalent of my first year engineering CS course (Prof specified it was only for those with prior programming experience)

You would need to understand how the function call stack works before you can implement the appropriate jumping logic, saving the callback address. 

Same with understanding how if/then/else/case statements, moving the appropriately transformed variables to the correct registers for comparison with zero, etc.

I just don't see anyone diving straight into assembly and implementing these control structures off the bat

=== Author: tentacle_===
that is a big problem. some people i’ve taught had misconceptions about high level language as analogous to learning another language like german or spanish.

as for asm, the mnemonics as just a less wordy form.

instead of saying compare the value of the memory location pointed to by (epb minus 8) with the literal 90 and set condition register with the results.

this is already a complex instruction. in academia we can start with a one instruction set computer eg. subleq but i prefer something with a minimal instruction set

btw with asm you don’t need to memorise all of them, few instructions are used frequently , the 80/20 thingy

=== Author: tentacle_===
with guidance you can. this isn’t even a chicken and egg problem. historically assembly was done even before the first high level languages came out. and it was done by run of the mill engineers, not einstein level geniuses.

which is why some CS curriculum, MIT i believe, has some courses going through the technical history of computing because the background is very lacking. i believe a course in assembly and digital logic should fill the gap alternatively.

QxV,What the government is (probably) not saying about COVID-19,405,fkwt4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fkwt4d/what_the_government_is_probably_not_saying_about/,146,1584593071.0,"There are lots of comments and posts about how the recent spike in infections is due to the government being ""complacent"". I don't think that's the case. Rather, I think the government is engaging in some cold-blooded, but necessary, math.

Specifically, what they are probably not saying in all their press conferences is that the math isn't just about how many people fall sick or die due to COVID-19, but balancing that with how many people will not survive economically because of the impact of the disease.

I am able to work from home. Most of my friends are too. That makes us the lucky ones. Why? Because there are billions of people around the world who work in service sectors who cannot do so, and are currently collecting unemployment, or straight up out of work. They still have to pay rent, utilities, food, etc. It is especially unfair because I work in tech, and probably have more savings as a buffer than someone who say, works as a waiter.

The reality is that shutting everything down has a cost. It's easy to say ""Oh just give everyone money to tide them over until all of this is over"". It's a harder decision to make when you expect that we won't be in the clear for up to a year.

And even if we lock down our country and shut ourselves away from the world (for 14 days, a month, 6 months, whatever), taking whatever economic hit in the process (which, by the way, is also tied to the health of our healthcare system), what do we do after? Especially when other countries are not acting as responsibly? Shut down the country until the US and Europe gets its act together? And watch our tourism industry slowly wither and die, taking thousands of people's livelihoods with it?

I'm not saying we should all be out partying. But at the same time, whatever we do, we need to accept as the new normal, and putting thousands of people out of work cannot be the new normal.

So, it's possible that the government is just ""complacent"". I think it's more likely that they know all of this, but nobody wants to hold a press conference explaining it.",2020-03-19 12:44:31,"

Thankfully, this sub isn't running our country. Many redditors and their short-sightedness do not understand that solutions (e.g. lockdown NOWWWWW) can lead to greater problems downstream that will be hard to recover from. Problems that may be worse than the actual virus impact itself.

SG is nothing without its economy for obvious reasons, and this isn't a world where another country will then donate money to us and our maybe-free-of-COVID unemployed unhappy citizens. Most countries can afford to force a lockdown with a lower cost than us because they have, say, natural resources. Thus, the optimal strat may involve the loss of some lives to the virus so that more lives are not lost to a poor economy.

The frying pan is not always better than the fire.

=== Author: AriesAscending===
The strategy isn't actually to contain the virus (which is probably impossible by now) but to slow it down so that healthcare facilites are not overwhelm and the patients can get the best possible treatment.

Think of it as a trolley problem. They are not gg to enact policies that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars in GDP to save 2-3 extra lives, especially when they can use the said money to save/improve 10,000 lives elsewhere.

But if the situation gets to point that it will cost tens of thousands of lives, they will turn the wheel.

I agree and think the government's hands are tied on this one. Defeating covid is going to take coordinated action by governments around the world and not these isolated decisions. 

Social distancing works but it puts a lot of strain on the economy. What if we were to give the entire world a vacation for a month so that non vital industries can go on lockdown? Rents and wages to be guaranteed by governments.

Thats something to ponder over. If you take 47 minus the 30ish import cases.. then the numbers are actually pretty 'standard'? And our immigration are filtering off imported cases for SHN, so maybe a lockdown isn't required at this point yet.

I think there are actually many public statements indicating that the Government has an eye on these issues. Consider the rushed adjustments to the Budget; PM's second public address (as much of a 'non-announcement' it was); CCS's xia suay download to business owners; Vivian's CNBC interview; and the incoming new assistance package to be released soon.

The messaging has been, ""we're in this for the long haul, we must be mentally prepared. The G will do what it can to help smooth out rough spots, but businesses should take the chance to reposition and build in resiliency, and employees should retrain and improve relevance. The economy feeds back into our healthcare, so measures have to stand up to sustainability. ""

I'm not saying that the G is omniscient and have identified everything, or even that they have the right answers. Neither am I saying that we should meekly believe that everything will be alright by just voting for PAP.

But I do believe that so long as we all take a somewhat grimly realistic assessment and do what we can to help ourselves and one another, we will at least be able to mitigate the impact this entire thing will have.

i don't see what's wrong with being ""cold blooded"" aka 'logical' and 'objective'.

I hate to say this and people don't like to hear but everyone is just a number. You are not unique or more important than the person next to you. Thus you are just number among the greater population. So ultimately, everyone is pooled together as the overall population number and a formula was used to determined the percentile of infected and from that, the percentile that will die from it via certain risk assessment. So the objective is NEVER to save EVERYONE but to minimize the infected and death from it.

Let's be honest, anyone that tries to tells you to inspire to save everyone is either an idiot or delusional as there's 0% of that even possible to achieve. We do what's the most possible. Not some miracle pipe dream.

Isn’t the spike largely due to imported cases?

=== Author: TowardsFitness===
This is something that cannot be controlled by individual governments in their countries, given the exchange of people across borders on a daily basis. Just remember than over 90% of the cases reported in the last 5 days are imported rather than community spread. So if other countries do not control situation in their geographies, no matter how long SG closes its borders, cases will jump up again as they open. 

An extreme (maybe theoretical) option is to quarantine the world for 14 days (again I understand the implementation difficulty in this, but is just a hypothetical statement). Which basically means all countries make it mandatory to close all public places, shops, malls, work place (except working from home) etc. with only critical services (medical, police, emergency services) working (ensure separate teams who do not mingle with any other team during this period e.g. Medical Team A works with only team A for the period). **We just need 14 days of no new infection to lower the total number of active cases, and end this pandemic**. Yes, there will be a monumental economical impact, but possibly the pain will be lower than months of pain as countries pass this virus to one another, closing their borders at different point in time.

From a practical perspective it is extremely difficult, nearly impossible, but even if we achieve 60-80% success, that is a lot lower number of cases, and we can lower the upper end of infectious cases drastically, which will ease the pressure on healthcare infra of a country. For those who are still ill after the 14 day period can be quarantined further till no new infections found, and it will give government a starting position again to control the numbers in case they see cluster coming up again.

This of course will need proper planning - maybe giving people a couple of weeks to stock up (panic control measures in place), and prepare themselves for isolation. Also, even if 70-80% of the countries participate in this initiatives, they can boycott the remaining 20% till the time the country steps up efforts to control the epidemic in their country. Again hypothetical, but a great way to put breaks on the rising cases.

=== Author: Zukiff===
Its a Perception vs reality issue. Reality is the spike are mostly imported cases. Local transmission have not seen a huge increase. The government has adjusted policy as we go along. Imported cases goes up, we start restricting travels. Calls for lock down Malaysian style are done by people not thinking. Malaysia cases are not imported cases, it's local transmission so a lock down is effective

Just look at China, they are loosening up the lockdown when everyone else is starting theirs, because local transmission is non existent but at the same time they have locked down on travelers going into China. You use what is needed not what everyone is doing

=== Author: desultoryquest===
The thing is that by taking drastic measures you can slow down the spread and buy time. There's a good chance that as countries learn more about the virus, we will discover better treatments and management strategies. So I think it still makes a lot of sense to shut things down temporarily.

Your point is worth explaining or spreading to more people, but this is pretty much what is happening across the whole world. All countries are trying to balance containing the virus and reducing economic impact, it's a very tight rope to walk on.

But I don't think it's something that the government is not saying. They pretty much said it many times already including in that Vivian Balakrishnan interview that people are sharing. He basically said no economy = no resources, no resources = cannot fight virus, so there must be some of both.

I mean the way you said it feels like it's some sort of secret plan. It's more just common sense.

There is also a factor of people unable to behave as a united whole. Go to DORSCON red or declare a nationwide lockdown and even the calm ones will start panic buying. 

The govt has to weigh two things, communicating information without inducing panic and imposing strict measures. To be honest, I see a short term lockdown coming soon. Places like Taiwan and Philippines closed their borders with just a few cases and now Malaysia joined the list. Essential services might operate on a segregated fashion but tourism and retail are already hit. The problem like you indicated is that a vast majority of the workforce need to work the service industry and a ton of them are foreigners. That's where the real nightmare begins

Its not about the economy. Govt can subsidise to pay for power bill, people can just consume rice and carbo. We will be fine its not as bad as a world war but close to it. 


Think of it this way, your income is screwed in wartime  but your expenses is screwed as well so it balances out. Tour guides can be retrain to become delivery guys. People have to be flexible see how they can do telesales work from home.

Govt can do some fiscal spending. Build 10000 electric charging points that can be used in the nezt 20 years. Whatever projects that used to cost 10 million in materials now only cost 5 million. We can even build oil tanks now to take advantage of the 20 bucks oil being pumped due to price war betweeb saudis

Of course there are jobs like hairdresser dentist whatever that has to be done in person. And outside of wearing hazmat suits they will have to be postponed for a while.

Point to add. If we ramp up testing kits to 50k kits a day. We can effectively test who has the virus and who doesnt. Batch process the entire country ot 5 million and quarantine 15 days anyone who has it confirmed. After they recover we become virus free and keep up stringent travel measures and work from there

What we can do is to review our policies who gets in Singapore. Look at this video by a Japanese filmmaker about Nanjing Measures

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfsdJGj3-jM) 

They managed to contain themselves to 100 cases and now all are recovered. Meanwhile they have extremely stringent measures to prevent import cases.

Singapore should e reviewing its own policy - and open its borders to cities like Nanking where things are contained.

In fact, if Singapore is worried about losing economically. Now is the time to trade the China Lockdown with the EU/US lockdown. China (outside wuhan) has almost no domestic transmissions - and is also one of our major sources of tourism. We can get some $$ back from them but locking ourselves down from dumbf\*ck Trump managed US, and a Boris that wants to pursue 'heard immunity' UK

""There is also a fallacy that there is a trade-off between healthcare and the economy. Actually, they are the both sides of the same coin. If you don't have an economy or don't have resources, which you can devote for the healthcare and keeping the society going, you then face a very sticky situation. ""

\- Vivian Balakrishnan's 11 Mar 2020 CNBC interview (from his facebook page), at 19:30 of the video

I think the Government is trying hard to balance containment (of COVID-19) and keeping the economy going. 

My way of looking at this is to divide the handling of the situation in stages. 

Singapore is similar to China, SK, HK that we have been actively dealing with COVID-19 since late Jan/ early Feb, unlike US/EU which started to take things more seriously at late Feb.

Hence, I believe our govt has more ""experience"" and measures already in place.

We probably do not need to adopt a ""shut down business"" measure now, which many countries are doing right now. That is probably used to buy time to come up with other measures (which we already have) and trace large number of unlinked cases/clusters (which we are doing fine for now) .

I'm sure our healthcare sector will be overjoyed when they are as overwhelmed as the doctors and nurses in Wuhan and Italy. /s

Everything has a price. Shutting down the country has a price. So is there a huge price to be paid for not shutting it down.

Our tourism industry is already dead in any case in the last few weeks, even more so after yesterday's announcement of quarantining all incoming arrivals for 14 days AND the fact that many countries are already starting to ban their citizens from leaving their own countries.

Stop looking at the cost of shutting down and start looking more carefully at the cost of NOT locking down. Look at the healthcare sector in Italy and Wuhan. Ask yourself, is that what you wish to see in Singapore.

It's true that you have to treat disease and economic variables at the same time. But your reasons either not valid or are too fuzzy to be useful. (1) SG is not unique in being ""nothing without its economy"". That's true of all countries. (2) The idea that natural resources buffer a COVID outbreak (economically? epidemiologically?) is fuzzy at best. Perhaps true if you're referring to domestic food production, though it remains to be seen how that sector will be affected by COVID. But, for example, having oil right now isn't doing you or your economy or your sick any good. Natural resources are resources only in presence of market demand and global markets are entering into a massive demand shock. (3) You're level of analysis is faulty: SG is deeply embedded in an int'l economy whose dynamics it does not control. Permitting the disease to spread here in the name of boosting economic performance is shortsighted since economic performance here is dependent upon global markets whose dynamics have nothing to do with whether we socially distance, work from home, or don't. (4) Think of the effect a laissez-faire, UK-style policy would have on the MNCs located here. Can you be sure they'd continue business as usual if they think the gov't is overly permissive in its response to COVID?

=== Author: wiltedpop===
I think your idea is too simplistic, no country can afford a lockdown longterm. Not china not usa. 

Lockdown is useful because it allows us a reset of transmission back to 0 or close to 0. If malaysia lockdown well they can get their cases back below 100 per day because those asymptomatics will be less effective

We will hit total lockdown soon when we hit 100+ cases/ day of community spread, i think thats when our gov will not want to take aby chances of becoming italy. Not just imported cases. In the meantime every biz n school needs to have their workfromhome policy going.

You clearly don't understand how bad the virus situation is given by what you have said. We are dealing with a worldwide virus Pandemic. This is not just some linear increase in cases, it's EXPONENTIAL, it will keep doubling if we are complacent. If we don't enact the appropriate measures now to deal with a droplet, we are going to be hit with the full force of a tsunami. And if we were hit by that, it's gonna take DECADES for the situation to recover.

The question is:

Do you want to take a hit in the economy now and stop the virus in its tracks?

Or keep things going as long as possible and risk getting people infected and dying and taking a big hit in our economy later?

Service sectors does not just include wait staffs.

**Prisoner's dilemma**

The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it ""prisoner's dilemma"", presenting it as follows:



Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.

Long term - border-controls, active testing of suspected cases, quarantine people in contact with those cases, contact tracing, SHN (stay home notice), WFH (work from home), staggered working/lunch hours, hygiene campaign (wash hands properly + frequently, don't touch face, don't anyhow throw tissue paper), stop going to work when sick, stop going aboard for non-essential reasons, hospitalization for all severe cases

I think that’s the fundamental thing that a lot of people can’t wrap their heads around: that it’s not so binary (I.e. EITHER “economy” OR “people’s lives”).

As far as possible, we don’t want to be dealing with 2 crises at the same time (pandemic AND total economic collapse). Shutting down now moves us (unnecessarily) closer to that possibility. 

Also, shutting down is not sustainable, given that this might drag on for a year. How long can we shut down for? Even if we manage to get to zero new infections for that time period, there’s going to be a new one or cluster eventually. And by then we’d have more businesses closed and people laid off VS the current “try our best to carry on” approach. 

I mostly agree with what the gov is doing right now... it works for the CURRENT situation. (Edit: I don’t agree with wanting to call for elections now)

BUT I will be the first to make a lot of noise when shit goes to hell; when the current arrangements are not valid options. 

Though, they’ve probably already planned for these scenarios ... e.g. according to my teacher friends, schools are preparing / ready for closure, just waiting for button to be pushed by MOE.

If we lockdown, how long do we lockdown?  What if the situation doesn't improve after the initial lockdown period? How long more do we continue? What if we continue for months but the situation doesn't improve? What if we lockdown until economy really cannot tank but the virus remain? What if after lockdown the virus resurfaces and people still die?

No one knows what will happen if we decide one way or another. Ultimately it's a judgment call that can only be judged upon hindsight.

It's not clear if people who got served Stay Home Notices are eligible for this scheme. SHN and Quarantine Orders are different, and there has been nothing suggesting otherwise (I tried looking it up yesterday).

The LOA/SHN allowance also doesn't cover those who came back some time _after_ their region was included — some people might not be doing it by choice, or aren't in a position to afford a same-day/next-day flight back.

Assuming that younger people will not get serious infections reducing productivity.. 4. Assuming that letting the disease take a portion of the population wouldn't cause mass panic resulting in a shutdown of demand. If you're wrong about #1 the game is lost. If you're wrong about #2-4 then it's likely that the economic consequences will be worse in your scenario than if we actively worked to suppress infections across the board.

I'm not worried about the cost of the kit. What I think will cost a lot will be the cost of logistics and making sure every single person takes the test within the same day for accuracy.

As funny as it is to make fun of the lazy Italians, Italy is one of the top ten largest economies in the world. The Italian economy is about 5-7 times larger than ours (depending on your source of data). Italy also has access to the European single market.

Italy also has sufficient domestic production and consumption, meaning that after a lock down they can at least rely on some domestic industries to exist.

Singapore on the other hand is not one of the top ten largest economies in the world, and we do not have any significant domestic industries at all and are reliant on international trade. There is also no common market in ASEAN. Locking down means nearly no international trade, and we don't have domestic industries to rely on when we eventually open up.

I believe the business are not asked to closed.

But people not suppose to go out, plus the business owners themselves also by right cannot go out effectively means close shop as well.

It also depends on the way it is planned.

Eg: Delivery services can still operate with strict no contact, similar to what Macs is doing now.

So this means then F&B still stays open for potential delivery business.

BUT depending on their operating model, it may not make much sense if their revenue is more from visiting customers and delivery is just additional revenue. So most F&B is still likely to close shop even if delivery is still on.

BUT then how about food? Again, this depends on the planning. Honestly no idea how a lock down is handled.

MY is bad example since their people are  still out and about.

Maybe lock down is not as bad as we think it might be as well. Not much examples in history for modern day lock down.

My assumption will be that there will still be services to perform the necessary duties which include ensuring that food supplies to people under lock down is ensured.

>1. You seem to be assuming that we can strategically target who gets sick and who doesn't. 

Countries can choose what mitigation strategies they take. This has some bearing on survival. Examples: UK announced 3 days ago (they did a U-turn so this has changed now) that there is no need to go to hospital or to have social segregation. It's business as usual. Only need to stay home 7 days if you're sick. This strategy was designed to let the majority of population contract the illness. The majority will survive, but you have probably heard that covid19 is more deadly for the elderly. So with this strategy, more elderly will die. Compare that with countries like Singapore or Taiwan that start contract tracing early and have extensive quarantines.

>2. You seem to be assuming that the older population are relatively unproductive economically and can be sacrificed. 

Read again what I wrote. It is your assumption, not mine.

>3. Assuming that younger people will not get serious infections reducing productivity.. 

This disease is less deadly for the young. Yes, some youngsters will still get severe illness and some will die, but by proportion it will be less so compared to elderly patients with chronic diseases.

>4. Assuming that letting the disease take a portion of the population wouldn't cause mass panic resulting in a shutdown of demand.

Yes, for countries who adopt this strategy, it is going to be either an exercise in  brinkmanship (they can switch tactic at the last minute and try to salvage both their reputation and the surviving population) or a gradual decline into chaos. It is not without risk.

>if you're wrong about #1 the game is lost. If you're wrong about #2-4 then it's likely that the economic consequences will be worse in your scenario than if we actively worked to suppress infections across the board.

It can be a calculated risk. If your country is full of young healthy people it might be an option.

Are you serious ? You will stand by the fact that those earning lesser such as retail staffs should continue going to work despite them having a considerable risk for getting the disease ? So we sacrifice the lower spectrum of our workforce to keep the economy going while they can catch the disease and live with the fact that it might kill them or inadvertently cause irreversible damage to their health ? 

I’m a practical man but I can’t believe what I’m seeing. Have Singaporeans become this practical ?

Is it just me who read china news articles? They already said that some young people in their 20s were hit with the virus, then developed a fever. After a few days their fever subsided, but the virus didn’t go away. Instead it continued attacking other organs, which quickly turned into organ failure. In the end, it caused death. Even that young celeb in his 20s in America who caught the virus said that he found it really difficult to breathe. So hopefully people can understand the severity of this situation. At times countries only divulge the fatality rate to prevent fearmongering and of course to prevent hoarding.

> # Coronavirus: New evidence shows young people are falling seriously ill

> NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - New evidence from Europe and the US suggests that younger adults aren't as impervious to the novel coronavirus that's circulating worldwide as originally thought.

> Despite initial data from China that showed elderly people and those with other health conditions were most vulnerable, young people - from twenty-somethings to those in their early forties - are falling seriously ill.

> Many require intensive care, according to reports from Italy and France. The risk is particularly dire for those with ailments that haven't yet been diagnosed.

> ""It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, here may be a disproportional number of infections among that group,"" Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in a press conference on Wednesday (March 18), citing the reports.

> The data bears out that concern.

> In Italy, the hardest hit country in Europe, almost a quarter of the nearly 28,000 coronavirus patients are between the ages of 19 and 50, according to data website Statista.

> Similar trends have been seen in the US.

> Among nearly 2,500 of the first coronavirus cases in the US, 705 were aged 20 to 44, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

> Between 15 per cent and 20 per cent eventually ended up in the hospital, including as many as 4 per cent who needed intensive care. Few died.

> One of those younger adults is assistant professor of genetics Clement Chow of the University of Utah.

> ""I'm young and not high risk, yet I am in the ICU with a very severe case,"" Asst Prof Chow said in a March 15 tweet.

> ""We really don't know much about this virus.""

> Related Story Interactive: How coronavirus is spreading across the world

> According to his Twitter posts, Asst Prof Chow had a low-grade fever for a few days and then a bad cough that led to respiratory failure.

> It turned out to be the coronavirus. He ended up on high flow oxygen in the ICU.

> When he arrived last Thursday, he was the first patient there.

> ""Now there are many more,"" he tweeted.

> Asst Prof Chow didn't give his age in the tweets, but his laboratory website indicates he graduated from college in 2003 and has two unruly children.

> He didn't respond to an e-mail and Bloomberg was unable to independently confirm his status as a patient.

> It's true that risk of death climbs precipitously with age.

> While there were only 144 patients over age 85, as many as 70 per cent were hospitalised and 29 per cent needed intensive care, according to the CDC report.

> One in four died, the agency said in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

> In the White House press conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump implored younger people to stop reckless behaviour, such as partying, going to the beach and hanging out at bars.

> Yet, as college campuses across the country close down and require students to leave, even the most conscientious young adults face a difficult choice.

> Finding their academic years abbreviated and graduation plans shattered, many are driving or flying home, where they risk of exposing their parents and grandparents to Covid-19.

> Related Story Facebook, Twitter crack down on coronavirus misinformation

> The same concerns apply to young people starting out in big cities who suddenly find themselves under pressure to head back to their hometowns.

> Ms Livia Calari's father has been begging her to come home for weeks. The 25-year-old and her boyfriend live in Brooklyn, New York, and have been nervously watching the warnings from officials intensify and the city they live in shut down.

> But they're staying put, for now at least.

> The couple has two cats they'd have to move. If they did hunker down with Ms Calari's father in Washington, DC, they would be asked to self-quarantine on a separate floor for two weeks.

> Plus, the thought of accidentally bringing the virus worries them.

> ""I have a lot of anxiety, maybe irrationally, about bringing it to him,"" Ms Calari said of her father, who's 65. ""I would feel awful.""

> After days of thinking over their options, they decided to stay in New York and re-evaluate if a lockdown gets to the point where they can't even leave their apartment to take walks.

> Infection-fighting officials are willing to go to unusual lengths to get the word out to young people where they congregate, including on the Pardon My Take podcast from Barstool Sports - one of the most popular sports shows with younger listeners.

> Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the hosts how stressful the outbreak has been.

> ""You cannot imagine,"" he said. ""You see what happened in China, you see what's happening in Italy. We have the virus in the United States, and we want to make sure by our efforts that we don't have that degree of disease and suffering that we are seeing in other countries.""

> And he called on young people to embrace the effort to protect themselves and the broader population.

> ""No one is invulnerable, but even if you are doing very well, you have to be a very important part of our national effort to contain the outbreak,"" Dr Fauci said.

> ""You are not a passive person in this. You are an important part of the active plan to contain this epidemic. We really do need you. This isn't something that can be successful without you.""

I’ve never experienced that but I heard that it’s seriously painful.

As for the swab, there are many online videos to show how it’s done. Some people even bled or puked after the swab test. It’s more painful than injections. A lot of people think that it’s just put in a bit then take out the swab. 

Anyway the sg government has said that they are trying to test if a spit test can replace the painful swab test. I’m crossing my fingers in hope that it’ll be successful.

I did the swab test in CGH recently. They'll jam it into your nostrils and your throat. But it's only a temporary pain. Doesn't really hurt too much

=== Author: mintygalore===
It can be quite uncomfortable to be intubated. The patient is usually put to sleep before it starts so they don't feel it. The endotracheal tube is inserted into the mouth and pushed down into the windpipe. The tube is connected to the ventilator, which will push air into the windpipe (where it will go down into the lungs) at set timings, i.e. it breathes for you.

=== Author: maenadery===
I'm not a medical professional, but it was explained to me by one that for a person to be on a ventilator, it means they can't really breathe on their own anymore, which also usually means they're not conscious or particularly aware of their surroundings. It takes a lot for your body to lose the ability to breathe on its own (it's one of the final signs they check for to see if a person is brain dead). Basically if someone tried to tube someone who was not in a state that requires it, yes, it would be horribly uncomfortable and painful, which is why it's only done for patients who need it.

=== Author: evilplushie===
I think if they really thought they were totally immune,  the young people are stupid. I mean they are safer but its not 100% guarantee that they won't be the unlucky one

=== Author: mintygalore===
When we intubate patients with respiratory failure, we put them to sleep so that they don't feel it. I don't think we ever intubate a conscious patient unless it was a serious emergency.

I think they phrased it that way so that there will be lesser chances of cross infection since those people that are queuing there have a high chance of having the virus.

> “Compulsory temperature screening has been implemented for all staff and visitors at all access points into SPS’ facilities,” SPS added.

> Frontline SPS officers are also issued with personal protection equipment including disposable masks and gloves, for use when interacting with newly admitted inmates or if they are required to interact with any suspected COVID-19 cases. Both staff and inmates are also regularly reminded to practise good personal hygiene and to be socially responsible.

> As of Thursday, SPS noted that none of its staff or inmates has been quarantined on suspicion of being infected with COVID-19.

> “SPS will continue to monitor the evolving situation and will consider adopting additional measures where necessary to ensure the health and safety of its staff and inmates.”

> The Ministry of Health on Wednesday confirmed a new single-day high of 47 COVID-19 cases in Singapore, bringing the total to 313.

> A variety of different combinations of interventions aimed at “flattening the epidemic curve” have popped up around the world, but time is needed for these to bear fruit, say the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Hsu Li Yang and Natasha Howard.

> SINGAPORE: The world is coming to grips with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that began last year in China and is now sweeping the globe.

> Much is now known about this virus, indicating we are facing a threat the scale of which has not been seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> One other thing is also certain: Letting the pandemic take its “natural course” is not an option we should consider.

> The main statistic driving action, despite the relative perceived mildness of most infections, is that approximately one in 20 confirmed adult cases will require mechanical ventilatory support, available primarily in hospital intensive care units.

> If demand exceeds supply of this relatively scarce and inelastic resource, fatality rates will increase dramatically beyond COVID-19’s current estimated fatality rate of 0.3 per cent to 1 per cent, as will deaths from any other conditions requiring hospitalisation and intensive care.

> IMPORTATION AND NEW OUTBREAKS LIKELY

> No country will be completely free from the threat of SARS-CoV-2 in the short and medium term.

> The SARS-CoV-2 virus will likely continue to circulate globally, perhaps becoming the fifth endemic human coronavirus, given that countries and territories are at different stages of the pandemic.

> China may have eliminated the virus from large segments of the country, while several Asian countries - including Singapore and South Korea - have slowed or managed its national spread.

> But Europe, North America and several countries in the Middle East are in the ascending phases of their epidemics, while African and South American countries are just starting to report cases.

> That means China, Singapore and other places thought to be recovering from the spread will remain vulnerable to virus importation and new outbreaks that are potentially as severe as the first wave as more than 99 per cent of their populations have not yet been infected.

> The spike of 17 imported cases in Singapore on Tuesday (Mar 17), with a further 33 on Wednesday, shows we must stay vigilant.

> HOW TO MANAGE THE PANDEMIC

> How can countries end or at least manage this pandemic? The answer lies in trying to convert a “tsunami” into multiple smaller and manageable “waves”.

> In epidemiological terms, if the effective reproduction number “R” of SARS-CoV-2 is brought below 1 – i.e. each infected person infects on average less than one other person – the outbreak will be on a downward trajectory and transmission will end once “R” reaches 0.

> If “R” remains just above 1, the local outbreak will spread more slowly and ultimately result in fewer persons infected – “flattening the epidemic curve” - thus not overwhelming the healthcare system.

> Many experts believe that the coordinated interventions implemented by China, if contextualised and applied globally, would end the pandemic – a metaphorical “global reboot”.

> 

> These measures include locking down regions with uncontrolled community transmission (as China did with Wuhan and large parts of Hubei) to prevent exportation of cases; aggressive case detection and contact tracing, with prompt isolation and treatment of cases and quarantining of close contacts; strict social distancing that includes cancelling mass events, curfews, and shutting down public transport where necessary; and logistical support to the population affected.

> Hundreds of foreigners were evacuated from Wuhan as the virus took hold. (Photo: AFP/STR)

> South Korea, however, chose a different model. Even at the height of the epidemic in Daegu, the city was not locked down. Instead, testing was ramped up rapidly, including setting up make-shift test centres near areas with many infections and novel drive-through testing.

> In just under three weeks, South Korea established a network of laboratories that could perform up to 20,000 tests a day, allowing for earlier diagnosis and isolation of cases, with mild infections isolated at home rather than in the hospital.

> Other social distancing interventions were more restrictive, including school closures and cancellation of large events.

> WORLD IS TRYING TO FLATTEN THE CURVE

> What we are seeing around the world in the past two weeks is a variety of different combinations of interventions aimed at “flattening the epidemic curve” but time is needed for these to bear fruit.

> Where there is already widespread community transmission, such as in parts of Italy or Spain, the interventions have resembled what occurred in Wuhan.

> Virtually all countries and territories to date have also significantly stepped up travel restrictions – including Malaysia this week – aimed at reducing one source of infections.

> The Causeway early in the morning at around 7.20am on Mar 18, 2020. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)

> Which particular intervention are more likely to work or which are redundant in terms of reducing “R” relative to their socioeconomic cost is dependent on the specific situation and health system in each country.

> However, the more restrictive and self-isolating interventions will exact considerable socioeconomic costs and negatively impact closely inter-dependent countries and territories.

> SINGAPORE MUST PREPARE FOR SPIKE IN CASES

> What does this mean for Singapore?

> Our country has thus far taken a relatively moderate approach to controlling the virus spread, focusing primarily on aggressive contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts of confirmed cases.

> However, we must not become complacent. We must prepare for a scenario in which significant case increases threatens to overwhelm our intensive-care resources.

> Such a scenario will require resolute implementation of more intrusive or liberty-limiting social distancing measures, as in China or Italy, to reduce “R” and achieve more manageable COVID-19 case numbers.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong referred to these reduction measures as the “extra brakes” in his address to the nation on Friday (Mar 12). Because such interventions are difficult to sustain, a plausible approach would be to ease off these interventions once containment is achieved, and reintroduce them, or “tap the brakes”, as needed - repeatedly if required.

> This may be more acceptable and feasible than the alternative of an indefinite national lockdown to attempt a “reboot” to a COVID-19-free state.

> INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE GUIDED BY SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

> Countries are most successful in mitigating the spread when their interventions are guided by the scientific evidence.

> Shoppers pass a thermal screening booth as part of precautions for the coronavirus at a mall in Singapore Feb 19, 2020. (Photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)

> In Singapore’s current situation where the majority of cases are imported, travel restrictions have been temporarily extended to all territories exporting cases even if official case numbers remain low.

> Alternatively, closing schools – given the data suggest that children are not the main transmission drivers - would not be helpful to bring down “R” except as a general signal of the gravity of the situation.

> Closing public transport or imposing curfews should only be done as a last resort in the context of a massive rise in unknown community clusters and deaths.

> It is important to note that we will not know how well any approach, whether our current moderate social distancing, more rigorous but temporary brake-tapping, a full lockdown and reboot, or some combination can work to reduce “R” before its implementation.

> Unlike a laboratory experiment, there is no way to reset and repeat interventions until we have definitive answers.

> Epidemiological modelling will only generate a narrower range of uncertainties. Interventions have to be implemented in imperfect conditions. The nature of outbreaks is such that the effect of any intervention on case counts will only start to be evident one to two weeks later.

> Passengers wearing face masks, amid concerns over the spread of COVID-19, walks through the arrival area at Changi International Airport in Singapore on Mar 16, 2020. (Photo: Roslan RAHMAN/AFP)

> Additionally, case numbers remain inaccurate as over 80 per cent of infected people – especially children – will experience mild symptoms and may never be diagnosed.

> Thus, countries that test extensively will detect more cases than those that do not, while countries with large numbers of deaths relative to cases, or that export cases, will have far higher proportions of infected but undetected cases.

> GETTING READY TO TAP THE BREAKS

> Our current approach in Singapore appears to be working and allowing a relatively sustainable balance between restrictions and normalcy.

> However, we must be prepared to quickly implement more restrictive social distancing measures – at least as a means of national brake-tapping – should COVID-19 case numbers begin to increase significantly.

ZeroPauper,PSA: Everyone has a social responsibility to keep your friends and family safe. Please try to defer any non-essential outings during the next ~2 weeks,81,fmgp4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fmgp4a/psa_everyone_has_a_social_responsibility_to_keep/,28,1584833462.0,"With [MOE suspending all overseas student exchanges](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/institutes-of-higher-learning-to-suspend-all-official-overseas-placements), we've had a whole lot of students and other Singaporeans travelling back in the past few days. Even though the government has implemented a mandatory SHN for all travelers arriving after 20 March 11.59pm, many of these people chose to rebook their flights to avoid this SHN. We have no idea if these people are carriers and if they have deliberately rebooked flights to avoid SHN, we can safely say that they're not going to take the necessary precautions in public.

We've had a big spike in the number of imported cases in the past few days, and we don't know for sure if 100% of COVID-19 carriers are detected because of the long incubation time. And because of that, the earliest we *might* see an increase in community spread would be **two weeks** from now. We also know that asymptomatic spread is a big possibility given the latest research([1](https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaa119/5807958), [2](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa198/5766430), [3](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/coronavirus-how-asymptomatic-carriers-spread-virus-like-covid-19), [4](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180#html_fulltext)). None of us want to unknowingly catch the virus and bring it back home to our elderly parents or grandparents.

If there is an increase in unlinked/imported cases, it will be very difficult for the authorities to contact trace, and there might be a higher risk of missing out affected persons. With how contagious COVID-19 is, all we need is *one* selfish person that has symptoms to go to crowded areas to create the next cluster.

Of course not everyone can defer travel or avoid crowds, a large number of people still have to attend school or go to work, while crowding in the rush hour madness.

But please try not to engage in non-essential social activities like clubbing, shopping, gatherings etc for the next two weeks.",2020-03-22 07:31:02,"

Is going back to school to prep for graded exams that will still happen in person, essential or not?

There is a literal construction site outside my bed room window since the end of CNY. I would love to not expose my family to any risk because they all have pre existing conditions, but the university is saying nope everything will proceed as per normal. So I guess people including myself will risk being incredibly sick as per normal given what an infectious virus does then.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
There is a middle ground you know? Use TraceTogether and we won't have to lock the city down. It's a compromise that I think can help resolve the question of how far must we go to contain potential spread.

=== Author: screwedforgp===
Exactly. It may be time to shut down clubs and cancel events.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
Things have been handled *really* well in Singapore compared to other countries. And that has lead to the downplay of COVID-19 seriousness/impact. I honestly feel that a lot of people in Singapore are not aware of how COVID-19 is spreading around the world, and thus are complacent. Everywhere else in the world that was hit hard was complacent, their citizens did not treat the virus seriously, and look what's happened.

The next 2 weeks might be the most crucial time in Singapore's COVID-19 journey.

=== Author: noootnooootnoot===
Totally agree. Currently in JC and most of my friends are still going out for fun or using the PW excuse to meet friends. Even in school before march hols, some students didnt separate their tables despite being instructed to do so and people still share food. I mean like wtf.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
You can try ask Encik to let you work from home

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
Given your circumstances I would say that your decision to head back to school to prep is warranted. I would suggest taking additional precautions not to interact with your family during this period, and practice personal hygiene, isolate yourself in your room as much as possible.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
There is no middle ground for this. No one should be going clubbing or any non essential outings at such a critical time in the COVID timeline. If an individual determines that clubbing is an essential activity in their lives at this point, **hell no they’re not going to be responsible enough to download the TraceTogether app.**

The purpose of the TraceTogether app are for individuals who have **no choice** but to travel for work/school, to allow authorities to track who you come into close contact with.

=== Author: potatetoe_tractor===
TraceTogether is not some magic elixir that eliminates the need for physical distancing. We still have to do our part to avoid non-essential gatherings or we're gonna end up with a clusterfuck of community spreads. So what is this ""compromise"" you speak of?

How would suggest I not interact with my family when I live with them? they literally will barge into my room. My dad whom I live with interacts on a daily basis with my grandmother who had a mini stroke right after CNY. My whole need to run back to school would have been removed if the uni allowed all of us to choose pass fail (which I gladly will) but they instead insist not only on it being graded, but that thousands of us turn up in one physical location next month. If it's just a pass, the motivation to escape the noise won't be as strong, I can screw up my sleeping pattern to study at night and sleep in the day...

We all know this virus will not go away next month but what definitely will happen is I will indirectly expose my already very vulnerable grandmother to so much risk, on an ordinary day, people will be calling me a combination of stupid and reckless.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
In my honest opinion that is not a long term sustainable solution. People need to eat, work and go out. The app will allow us to quickly isolate and keep cases under control. As long as the world at large is exporting cases, we cannot be sure that we will not have one person infect multiple. 

We can arrest it early and life can largely go on. If we lock down, even for 2 weeks, the economic damage will be incalculable, and even then, it may not be effective because we will still be importing cases from the world.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
And there will still be people who don’t take it seriously. 2 months will become 3 months, and then what.. 

I can’t really think of a solution for this, there will always be people with selfish mentality in any society.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
I’m assuming from your post history that you’re a university student, so you’d be at least 18 years of age. Your family barging into your room as and when they like is of an issue, and you should have a good talk with them (maybe Skype or something, I’m joking).

Gather some primary sources on COVID-19 (You can find a lot on subs like r/coronavirus, r/china_flu, r/COVID19. Just make sure they’re reliable sources), list them all out or do a summary and share them with your dad, and make sure he understands that it’s for their safety, especially your grandmother.

I don’t see any other way, you’re no longer a kid. Stand up for yourself, protect your own privacy.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
I said 2 weeks, not 2 years. Sacrificing 2 weeks of your clubbing won’t economically kill the club, Nor will you die from alcohol withdrawal.

This app will only work if everyone downloads it. And like I’ve said, what are the chances that an individual that determines clubbing to be an essential activity be responsible enough to think about this? Close to none. 


If we don’t get past this 2 weeks, community spread will only be exponential. And because not everyone has the social responsibility to download this tracking app, some cases will go untraced, and that’s where our problem starts. The authorities have been able to solve most if not all community spread because the number has been kept Low. They’re all humans, and have limited capabilities (time for example).

=== Author: wiltedpop===
i agree. the app will go a long way towards making contact tacing more efficient, maybe only 5% of manpower necessary.

&#x200B;

I think they should offer $100 bucks per install to all singaporeans, and just get the ball rolling, also serves as a default power bill subsidy for this stay-at-home period.

&#x200B;

just thinking of all those ah long and loansharks making serious cash now

=== Author: Lethaldart===
No, I am in agreement that if we can avoid going to clubs, community gatherings, and so on it will be good. Large mass gatherings are a sure way to spread the virus. 

My point is: The world at large is exporting cases. We have some low levels of community spread. We are looking at something longer than two weeks, it may be two months or more. Can we lock down for two months? 

The contact tracing app will help reduce the r0 number of the virus if we can get even a small number of people to use it, even just 1% of the population using it can lead to a huge chain of contacts being isolated. Virus transmission isnt guaranteed, so isolating close contacts can reduce that probability every effectively. 

We do not need 'EVERYONE' to have the app. We just need enough. At 1% we will see cases being referred via the app. At 10% we will potentially slow the spread. At even higher numbers we can afford to have a slow rate of infection and continue life as normal, unless you're in a vulnerable group.

I want to refer to you my post about the statistics about the app and how effective it can be. Even at 1% penetration it will have some meaningful result. Please consider the timeframe being longer than 2 weeks for this virus. We are in this for the long haul. We need long term sustainable solutions.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
The reason why I identified this 2 weeks as most critical is: 

Because of the influx of Singaporeans returning home from overseas **before** the mandatory 14 day SHN. I am particularly concerned about those people who deliberately rebooked their flights so that they can avoid this SHN. 

The community spread that follows because of this will be from these selfish individuals who prioritise their own movement and freedom more than the health of our society as a whole. 

Any traveller entering Singapore after 20 March 11.59pm will be required to serve a mandatory SHN, which mitigates the risk of community spread to a large extent. Of course there will be people who flout the SHN, or possibly pass it to their family members, but then it will be easy to trace.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Absolutely true, but this is not complete quite yet. You're forgetting every day we are starting to see about 10 or so cases locally transmitted, and some are unlinked. This is the time for decisive action. SHN is our strategy for those from abroad. TraceTogether and Social Distancing are for our domestic cases. 

I think that action is to ramp up contact tracing, and one of the best ways to do it is with the app. The app is targeted and specific, only to be used in the case of confirmed detection and infection. 

You may feel it is un-necessary, but I am predisposed to err on the side of caution. I think the government will assess the effectiveness of the app and may tell the civil service to adopt it in the very near future. But before they do that, I want to reassure everyone that the benefit outweighs the risk, and no malice is intended.

=== Author: ZeroPauper===
To be clear, I am in agreement with you that this app facilitates contact tracing and we should be using it.

> # Thousands of Muslim pilgrims brave COVID-19 to gather in Indonesia

> JAKARTA: Thousands of Muslim pilgrims from across Asia gathered in Indonesia on Wednesday (Mar 18), despite fears that their meeting could fuel the spread of a coronavirus, just two weeks after a similar event in Malaysia caused more than 500 infections.

> Organisers and regional officials said the event in the world's fourth most populous nation had begun, although the regional police chief said he was making a last ditch-effort to persuade organisers to call it off.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""We are more afraid of God,"" one of the organisers, Mustari Bahranuddin, told Reuters, when asked about the risk of participants spreading the virus at the event in Gowa in Indonesia's province of South Sulawesi.

> ""Because everyone's human, we fear illnesses, death,"" he said. ""But there's something more to the body, which is our soul.""

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Organisers had rejected a formal request from authorities to postpone the gathering, said a regional official, Arifuddin Saeni.

> He estimated that 8,695 people had already assembled in Gowa, near the provincial city of Makassar, adding that the numbers would make it hard to put a halt to the proceedings.

> ""They are still coming,"" he said. ""There are people from Thailand, Arabia, India and the Philippines.""

> The Malaysian event, held from Feb 27 to Mar 1, drew 16,000 followers.

> Both gatherings in Indonesia and Malaysia were organised by members of Tablighi Jama'at, a global movement of evangelical Muslims that promotes proselytising, known as dakwah.

> HUNDREDS INFECTED IN MALAYSIA

> About two-thirds of Malaysia’s 790 infections have been traced to the meeting at a mosque complex on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, the capital.

> Tiny neighbour Brunei has confirmed 50 infections linked to it, while Cambodia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam have also said citizens were infected there.

> Organisers in Indonesia were checking pilgrims' temperatures as a precaution, Bahranuddin added. Saeni said health officials had visited the site and asked to monitor participants.

> By Wednesday, Indonesia's tally of infections stood at 227, with 19 deaths. The nation of 260 million had run just 1,255 tests by Tuesday. By contrast, South Korea, with a population of a fifth that size, is doing more than 15,000 tests a day.

> The Indonesian and Malaysian meetings had been organised by different groups, Bahranuddin said. Even so, he added, ""Our purpose is one, even if the name changes, which is how we take religion to other people.""

> The same social media accounts were used to promote both events. One Facebook account displayed a photograph of a prominent Indian Tablighi cleric, Sheikh Maulana Ibrahim Dewla, leaving Kuala Lumpur airport on Tuesday for the Indonesia event.

> Images on the account, Aalmi Tablighi Shura Elders, showed men setting up huge tents at the Indonesia site, and described them as having arrived early from Gulf nations to offer help.

> Promotional material for the Indonesian gathering reviewed by Reuters read, ""The pleasure of living in this world is only a little, compared to the afterlife.""

The Indonesian Heath Minister said Indonesia’s initial zero infection count was due to the “strength of prayer” and “protection from the Almighty”. This when a country of 260 million people had not done many tests at that point.

I truly hope that this message is irrelevant to you and your family. Am sure VA will do their part to help tracing, but if you do know somebody who was there, let them know.

**

We were informed earlier today, 18 March 2020, that a Virgin Active member has tested positive for Coronavirus (COVID-19). The member visited Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar on the 16th March, and has not visited since.  

As of today 18th March, we have carried out a deep clean and thorough disinfection at Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar. Further to this, all common areas such as lifts and toilets in the building are also being treated in accordance with Ministry of Health guidelines.
We have also organized for an NEA approved company to come in to disinfect the entire club this evening, 18th March.

In conjunction with this confirmation, a specialist team from Ministry of Health is in the process of conducting detailed contact tracing with all employees, members, freelancers, contracts and other parties that the member may have come in contact with.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised that Virgin Active Tanjong Pagar can continue to operate as normal, therefore this club will remain open as per standard operating hours.

Virgin Active Singapore will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that the wellbeing of employees, members and partners is safeguarded.
We will be reaching via email out to all members who were in the club during the same time period as the diagnosed member.  

The safety and wellbeing of our members, our staff and our suppliers is our utmost priority at Virgin Active and we are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment within our clubs.

Only a madman would call an election during a pandemic.

The smart thing to do is handle the pandemic well. Landslide victory for PAP if they manage to keep up the good work till the end of pandemic.

They can call it a few months after everything settles down.

I don't think PAP is so stupid to undo all the good work they have done to win an election that they have in the bag regardless of timing.

> # PSP 'strongly' urges Government not to hold General Election amid COVID-19 crisis: Tan Cheng Bock

> SINGAPORE: Progress Singapore Party (PSP) chief Tan Cheng Bock has joined other opposition leaders in pressing for the next General Election not to be held until after the COVID-19 outbreak.

> ""We have a COVID-19 pandemic crisis now. Is it wise to hold a General Election in the midst of this COVID-19 pandemic?"" he said in a video statement on the party's Facebook page on Saturday (Mar 14).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""We are exposing more than 2.6 million voters to the virus on Polling Day because voting is compulsory and everyone must go to the polling stations to cast their votes.""

> He pointed out that rallies and election activities during election campaigning can lead to mass exposure to the virus.

> ""Holding a General Election at this time should not be considered,"" he said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 212 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Singapore, with 105 patients recovered and discharged from hospital.

> Authorities in Singapore had on Friday announced additional social-distancing measures, such as deferring or cancelling events attended by more than 250 people.

> All mosques have been temporarily shut for cleaning after a number of Singaporeans were infected with COVID-19 at a religious gathering in Malaysia. Many churches and other places of worship have also suspended services and mass activities.

> 

> The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee released its report on Friday announcing changes to the electoral divisions in Singapore.

> This is seen by most as a sign that elections are imminent, with past polls being held no more than three months after the report's release.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has not ruled out holding the General Election amid the COVID-19 crisis, saying in a Facebook post on Saturday that Singapore can hold elections after things stabilise or call elections early.

> 

> “We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that,” he wrote.

> “Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.”

> Precautions will be taken if elections are to be held before the COVID-19 situation is over, he added.

> 

> Other opposition parties, including the Singapore Democratic Party and the Singapore People's Party, have also voiced objections to elections being called in such circumstances.

> 

> Dr Tan raised three alternatives: To hold the election when COVID-19 is ""no longer a crisis"", to hold it at the end of the current government's term in April 2021, or to delay it even after that.

> ""If the pandemic is still with us by then, the President can exercise her soft power and form a caretaker government consisting of some of the current MPs,"" he said. ""Subsequently, call for fresh elections when COVID-19 is no longer a crisis.""

> 

> He added: ""(The PSP) strongly urge the Government not to hold a General Election while the COVID-19 pandemic is still with us.""

> On Saturday night, Reform Party leader Kenneth Jeyaretnam added his objections to calling the election during the coronavirus outbreak, while declaring where the party will stand if the election is called.

> 

> ""This is a fake election that is totally unnecessary and called before it's due. Clear proof that the PM puts himself first, then the interests of his family, his party before lastly the interests of the country,"" he wrote.

> ""But whatever the date Reform Party will be contesting West Coast as it has in 2011 and 2015. We will also be contesting Ang Mo Kio, Radin Mas and the new SMC of Yio Chu Kang which has been hived off from AMK (Ang Mo Kio).""

A plagues descends on a small nation, and the number of cases soon turns into a flood. As the numbers rise, the local preacher and his congregate kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by social distancing. By and by, one of the government official comes up the street wearing a mask.

""Oi, what time liao still dun wan stop ah?""

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Still the cases rise. Now some of the congregate are showing symptoms, coughing their lungs in supplication, when a doctor zips up with some hand sanitizer.

""Come lah, Preacher. Don't be stubborn leh. DORSON gonna break red any minute.""

Once again, the preacher is unmoved. ""I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.""

After a while DORSCON goes red, and the precautions rushes over the nation until only the church remains a place of congregation. The preacher is up there, preaching to his flock, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a LHL calls down to him through a megaphone.

""We highly recommend you stop the services, Mr Preacher. This is you and your members' last chance.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he gets infected and dies.

A pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, ""Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver us from the virus?""

God shakes his head. ""NB, Limpeh send gahmen official, limpeh send doctor, limpeh even send LHL, you all don't want listen still come blame limpeh""

> unless otherwise advised, all regular worship services should continue under the control measures issued by the Government and the heads of our respective denominations

=== Author: ahbengtothemax===
NCCS membership is not mandatory to operate in Singapore and there are a large number of independent churches.

=== Author: JokerMother===
oh yes! how can i forget that

=== Author: dominiczou===
That's in relation to Government decision-making.  Not religious decision-making.  Might be better for the influence to be harmonious? I have no idea how the Catholic Archbishop's decision was arrived at, but he has benefit of consultation from a multiparty committee including reps from MOH and the Catholic Medical Guild.

=== Author: Dunkjoe===
Thanks, I see, and meanwhile we keep wondering why new church clusters keep appearing...

Maybe it's time for new restrictions from the people above NCCS?

Reduction of imported cases is important, but non-imported cases has been quite steady in the near 2 months of the coronavirus period in Singapore.

=== Author: veryfascinating===
Well the Protestants have NCCS, but the NCCS’s president believes that worship services are not like your normal events and social gatherings and hence must go on. The head already believes his congregation is safe despite government calls for large gatherings >250, calls for social distancing, etc but nah, wiping down seats is enough. 

I used to think that Muslims with their cleansing ritual before they enter a mosque, would be safer than anyone of any other religion when they worship. But seems like the Malaysian religious event case proved otherwise, and even mosques are closed. Meanwhile the latest report about NCCS is that they’re “meeting the government to discuss a new guideline”. Still not encouraging closure of all churches and services. 

Btw, it’s not about government decision making or religious decision making. It’s all about the community. Christians saw fit that a Watain concert would be detrimental to society so they took to the streets (figuratively) to get them to stop. Irony is that Covid 19 is a bigger threat to community and more direct in that it affects your health and life and death matters. But they do not see it fitting to stop their services until all blows over.

=== Author: dominiczou===
My point being the Watain decision is inherently more sensitive to a show of demagogic force than, say, the NCSS or Catholic decisions. But yes I agree I thought Muslim ablutions might have helped but if you are infected then ... maybe not? Not sure if water helps or hinders the spread.

I think it is super important for us to understand that today’s increase in cases are kinda expected, with us asking Singaporeans to return back home from overseas. The large numbers may seem scary, but it is really not cause for alarm.
We are expecting the numbers to rise over the next few days as Singaporeans return from overseas. 

And we also need to understand that when we “flatten the curve”, we are trying to slow down the increase in cases, BUT, the entire duration of the outbreak is expected to be longer. 


So really, we need to understand that as scary as these numbers may seem, we need to understand what they mean and know that it is entirely expected. So please, if you understand what I’m trying to say here, try to educate your parents/auntie/uncle and tell them that Singapore is not becoming the next Wuhan/Italy/UK. Undue panic and alarm will self pawn us before the virus.

=== Author: rockymountain05===
It's a very real possibility for sure. The worry lies in if our healthcare system has the capacity to manage. The govt did say that in this scenario they are preparing for mild cases to be at alternate facilities or at home instead of in hospital I guess. I wonder what would cause the govt the decide on DORSCON red? Like daily triple digit increase?

=== Author: justmewayne===
""It's important to go beyond the headline number; we need to understand what is in that number of new cases. If the vast majority of our new cases continue to be people — returning Singaporeans from overseas, or residents living, working, studying overseas — they come back, we are going to isolate them for 14 days, and then they report symptoms. I would be less alarmed because we can deal with that problem, and we want to treat all Singaporeans who are returning too.""

The exponential curve is inevitable. Like Italy and the US.

=== Author: chrisycr===
RED would mean the situation is out of control and it will amount to a total ban on movement like what Malaysia is doing. I think that will happen only if there is massive community spread that cannot be contained. 

Right now, and even if there is triple digit infection, if these are mostly imported cases from people returning, and as long as hospital systems are not overwhelmed, should be OK.

=== Author: yummybeefwellington===
Wise words and definitely the most important thing to take note of!

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Truly Singaporean, his speech was like 90% perfect English and 10% Singlish-tone

=== Author: leagcy===
I'm watching the situation back home and the situation here in the states and one of the things that our government is doing well is the bullshit control. Because he tells you x and y can happen in the worst case you believe the rest of what he is saying. Here the federal government keep saying everything fine and dandy, very hard to take them seriously at all.

=== Author: xMrAngryPie===
My guessing is that when it reaches a point where there is more and more import cases till the hospital couldn’t cope, the Govt will ban all travellers back to Singapore even it is a citizen here. Prioritise the people who are still in Singapore. 

The reason is because you might spreading the virus on board flight unknowing and cause a cluster spreading in the community. That might be the reason why all travellers need 14days SHN.

=== Author: sageadam===
So you want the government to fear monger before you will start listening to what they say? Our government did not say ""everything fine and dandy"".  They tell it as it is. Our PM even gave warning that things will get much worse before it gets better. What the flying fuck are you talking about?

Edit : I misread OP's comment. Please downvote me hehe

=== Author: MrFickless===
Govt will not hang our own citizens out to dry like that. If it reaches that point, I believe our citizens should still be let in, but shipped straight off to isolation or quarantine.

They have already stated that if you are overseas unnecessarily, and you get hit with a SHN, it’s on you. Govt will no longer pay out the $100/day for loss of income, and leave will be taken from your personal annual leave. That should already deter most people from even going overseas.

=== Author: tseah===
If we ever do that, we will essentially devalue our citizenship to no better than being stateless. Government recognises this fact very well.

=== Author: leagcy===
Idk if you read my comment properly but im saying LHL and the the MOH did well to give proper information and the US is full of shit. 

Im also saying the opposite of what you are accusing me of, because they tell us the worst case it lends credence to the whole message.

Ada lebih makna di dalam bulan Ramadhan selain bazaar, bang. 

The bazaar helps forge closer relationships and is fun to go to with friends and family but it won’t be there forever. Eventually it will make way for something else or take another form and people will still have opinions about it whether we like it or not. It’s human nature.

One month after Singapore upgraded its coronavirus alert level to  Dorscon Orange, the disease has since hurtled on to wreak havoc in other  countries in Asia, Europe and North America.

Singapore was briefly the country with the second most infections and  its early exposure to the disease led it up the steep learning curve  ahead of others. The brutal experience with Sars - severe acute  respiratory syndrome - in 2003 has prepared Singapore well for the  coronavirus, and it has since drawn praise from the World Health  Organisation and international experts for its effective containment  measures.

However, it would be premature and indeed foolish to celebrate, given that the coronavirus continues to lob curveballs at us.

As it is also highly contagious, containing this insidious pathogen  involves everyone and this is why effective communication is especially  vital.

Even in the span of weeks, Singapore's brush with it has been  intense, enabling it to distil crucial lessons in what has worked,  floundered or faltered in communicating during a crisis.

I identify here five lessons.

#### 1. Transparency amid turmoil

The coronavirus first reared its head in Singapore in late January to  massive confusion. There was grave uncertainty on whether it would be  as deadly as Sars. Data from China was alarming yet inconclusive, and  worse, headlines and images from Wuhan on the rising fatality rate and  high profile deaths of several doctors heightened fears. It was in such  chaotic circumstances that the Singapore Government had to exert control  and assert authority.

Its  response was one of transparency. Singapore convened regular high-level  press conferences involving its multi-ministerial task force, with  leaders giving unambiguous information about the measures being taken.  This included quarantining contacts of those infected, imposing travel  bans and advisories, testing and treating cases, and implementing  healthcare-related precautions. Channels were set up to provide the  public with reliable and timely information to counter fake news.

The transparency and regularity with which information was provided,  including hard data on the number and profile of cases and their mutual  connections, offered welcome clarity amid a fog of doubt.

#### 2. Consistency trumps confusion

Despite these efforts, confusion reigned because of the lack of clear  information on the disease. One salient point of contention was whether  to mask or not to mask.

Footage from China depicted people donning masks, as if to suggest  that masks are vital protection. In Singapore's initial weeks of  reckoning with the coronavirus, people were increasingly seen wearing  masks on trains and in crowded areas.

>**We must avoid becoming  cavalier about the disease, especially given the concern over imported  cases sparking a second wave of infections here. The fight with the  coronavirus is predicted to be long-drawn.**

However, as health experts advised, masks have limited use in  preventing infection in casual contact and pales in comparison to the  mundane practice of hand-washing. With people in Singapore beginning to  stockpile masks, setting the record straight to ensure a healthy supply  of masks for healthcare workers was critical.

To arrest this trend, consistency of messaging was key, not just in  words but also in deeds. So political leaders were never seen wearing  masks in public engagements. This was in sharp contrast to Hong Kong or  South Korea, where Chief Executive Carrie Lam and President Moon Jae-in  were often pictured with masks on.

With all-round reinforcement of the message that masking up was  neither necessary nor useful, the wearing and hoarding of masks tapered  off. Consistency of messaging thus trumped confusion.

#### 3. Partnership with community

As the coronavirus knows no geographical, cultural or demographic  boundaries, Singapore's collective resistance is only as strong as its  weakest link.

Hence, top-down communication alone cannot effectively reach  everyone. A groundswell of supportive voices rose, including celebrity  blogger Mr Brown's Kim Huat Takes The Bus videos, artist Weiman Kow's  appealing infocomics on the virus and other community initiatives that  organically emerged to strengthen the chorus around socially responsible  behaviour.

A slew of community efforts also sprung up, such as #braveheartsg  that supports front-line medical staff and Better.sg that connects  people with extra masks and sanitisers to those in need, demonstrating  the importance of partnership with the community to bring everyone on  board the fight against the virus.

#### 4. Reassurance over condescension

We cannot underestimate the adverse psychological impact of a threat  such as Covid-19 that seems simultaneously immediate, yet remote. People  feel beleaguered and desperate to protect themselves and their loved  ones, and to achieve some semblance of control over this amorphous  hazard. To ensure that public messaging hits home, an empathetic stance  that does not dismiss people's fears but acknowledges their concerns  will more greatly resonate.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's two national addresses on the  coronavirus have been commendable in this regard: authoritative yet  reassuring.

Notably, the mixed response to the leaked audio of Trade and Industry  Minister Chan Chun Sing's closed-door discussion at the Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggests that old-fashioned  common sense delivered with candour may appeal to some, but grate on  others. It is safe to say that reassurance ultimately prevails over  condescension.

#### 5. Normalcy without complacency

The final and perhaps most difficult lesson to fully grasp is how  Singapore must now build a sense of normalcy without falling prey to  complacency.

The Republic has so far managed to contain the virus to some extent  without needing to lock down the city. People have mostly gone about  business as usual, albeit with minor inconveniences such as contact  tracing measures and workplace adaptations.

However, we must avoid becoming cavalier about the disease,  especially given the concern over imported cases sparking a second wave  of infections here. The fight with the coronavirus is predicted to be  long-drawn. Even as cases stabilise in China, where the virus initiated,  infections are now rising into the thousands in Europe, the new  epicentre of the pandemic. Should cases be imported to spark a rise in  community transmissions here, we may need to consider stricter  procedures as well.

This means we must steadfastly accept that managing this disease is  part of our lived reality, proceed with life as normal, but not let up  in taking the necessary safeguards.

Inevitably, people do experience campaign fatigue over time, so  strategies must be developed to maintain awareness about the coronavirus  and refresh public messaging at appropriate intervals. This may be  achieved through crafting novel slogans, recruiting new spokesmen or  experimenting with alternative communication platforms.

Attaining normalcy without breeding complacency will be a formidable challenge, but one Singapore must strive to achieve.

In the ongoing bid to stamp out the coronavirus, we have also had to  combat fake news and herd mentality such as panic buying. While we have  yet to decisively win these battles, we can nevertheless draw valuable  insights to sharpen our communication and messaging, so as to inoculate  everyone against disease, distortions and disinformation.

Taiwan is also another country that has been managing the virus spread very promptly and efficiently. They are super strict with punishing those who disobeyed quarantine orders, something which our side learnt later on (actually debatable, could be vice versa, but either way, they recognised early the need to be strict). They also have the highest critical care bed provision per 100k Population in this part of Asia, far exceeding everyone else [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338520008_Critical_Care_Bed_Capacity_in_Asian_Countries_and_Regions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338520008_Critical_Care_Bed_Capacity_in_Asian_Countries_and_Regions). They are super prepared.  
  
However, WHO does not recognise Taiwan as a legitimate country, due to pressures from Beijing, and has blocked their membership. This means that Taiwan intially didn't get to share their knowledge in the conferences. It was only after much deliberation that WHO allowed Taiwanese experts to join the conference as independent experts (not tied to any nationality). Seriously.  
  
Taiwan numba wan.  
  
Edit: I also want to add that many data/graphs don't show Taiwan's actual figures. Instead, they grouped Taiwan and her pandemic casualty rates under the clusterfuck that is China's.

This part is puzzling. Why would foreign media be afraid to report about Taiwan's stellar performance in handling a health epidemic? 

After all, this is useful so that others can learn from them. It's not about politics nor sovereignty.

Also, CNA does report about Taiwan's handling of the crisis. If CNA can, why can't others?

Issues regarding Taiwan's independence is hardly \`petty politics' to the PRC --- it is actually quite fundamental to the CCP's political legitimacy. In Singapore, our stance is relatively straightforward --- promote cooperation between nation states, free flow of good and information etc. Since we are small and rely on trade, anything good from a utilitarian perspective is also good for us. Also, being a young nation with little historical baggage helps.

The same cannot be said for most other nations. US-China, China-Japan, Japan-Korea, Korea-DPRK, whichever. In many of these, rabid competition and a race towards supremacy and dominance makes it much closer to a zero-sum game than in Singapore's case.

China. If WHO doesn't talk about Taiwan, there isn't much to report about. And the last thing WHO want is for China to close up in protest of them recognizing Taiwan and stop sharing information about the virus.  
  
China has over and over again boycotted organizations such as UN, map makers, corporation just because they listed Taiwan as Taiwan.

=== Author: kanteater===
I would respectfully disagree that it is quite fundamental to CCP's political legitimacy. Claiming ROC to be an independent nation consisting of Taiwan does not mean that they are disregarding PRC belongs to CCP and consists of Mainland China.    

  

In 1949, Mao (founding father of CCP and PRC) wanted to invade Taiwan to chase away KMT, but didn't do it. This is admission that (a) CCP and PRC only had control of Mainland China thus far; (b) Taiwan still belonged to someone else and has to be conquered in order to become part of CCP and PRC. If you didn't invade it then, you cannot claim that it is yours all along 50 years later.  

  

So yes, I would say it is Petty. Because if Mao was alive, he would claim that they never wanted Taiwan, the island, to begin with (refuse to admit they couldn't and didn't invade Taiwan, the island).  

  

Disclaimer: I have derived my conclusion based on the info available to me. Of course, the issue is a lot more complex than what I can comprehend, and I don't know what I don't know.

Because they are part of China. Whether you view them as the legit govt of China or Beijing as the legit govt of China is up to you but even under the current DPP govt they have not officially ditch the one China policy. Fact is Taiwan is not a country, and WHO only recognize sovereign nations that are members of the UN.

Right now the Bejing govt is the one recognized by the UN, you can complain about them making life difficult for Taiwan,  no one is going to dispute that, but it doesn't change a fact. Taiwan as far as UN is concern is part of China. Taiwan not going through Beijing to report their cases is them playing politics. It would be akin to Johor reporting cases separately from the rest of Malaysia just because the state govt hates the federal govt

=== Author: calicotrinket===
Arguably the main reason Mao was drawn away from attacking Taiwan was the Communists failing to make a landing on Kinmen Island, and subsequently the Korean War broke out. When that ended the US had set up a defense treaty with Taiwan, hence the CCP never attacked them.

China operates on a very different system compared to what we think - hell they keep banging on about their nine dash lines - so obviously they would claim that Taiwan has always been theirs and was just merely under its own system, hence ""one country two systems"". And because of that, they are desperate to not give Taiwan its own say because it'll imply Taiwan is its very own sovereign state.

I don't really have a good idea how to translate those Chinese beliefs into something easier to understand, but basically China would never allow Taiwan to have its own say, since their other claims to other territories would fall apart.

=== Author: kanteater===
Yes, I understand your point, but you must see that you are starting from a convenient point in history where it suits a particular narrative. Let's go back and rewind. All are facts unless written with Disputable disclaimer.   
  
Before starting, let's define properly because we both have been the terms using it loosely:   
Taiwan = Geographical boundary of the island, Taiwan   
Mainland China = Geographical boundary of Mainland China   
ROC = Republic of China = used to represent the geographical boundary of Mainland China + Taiwan, now represents the geographical boundary of Taiwan (Disputable)   
PRC = People's Republic of China = currently represents the territorial boundary of Mainland China + Taiwan (Disputable)   
TMH = TongMengHui = Revolutionary Alliance (predecessors of KMT), an underground political party formed in 1905, formalised as a proper political party in 1912   
KMT = KuoMingTang = Chinese Nationalist Party, a political party formed in 1919    
CPC = Communist Party of China, a political party formed in 1921   
   
1644-1911: Qing Dynasty ruled over the territorial boundary of Mainland China + Taiwan  
1850-1864: Taiping Rebellion, whereby Qing Dynasty was forced to give provincial governors more autonomy  
1911: TMH-led Xinghai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, TMH set up ROC, but provinces are militarily/politically/judicially  fragmented as aftermath of Taiping Rebellion  
1916-1928: Warlord Era in ROC  
1919: TMH reformed to KMT  
1927-1937: first phase of Chinese Civil War going on intermittently, KMT vs CPC  
1928: KMT's reunification of whole of Mainland China via Nanping Expedition  
1928-1949: KMT was sole-ruling party in whole of ROC, which consists of Mainland China + Taiwan    
1939-1945: World War II, Axis lost  
1945: Double Tenth Agreement between KMT and CPC, whereby CPC acknowledged that KMT was the legitimate government  
1945: Japanese ordered to surrender to the KMT troops  
1946-1949: second phase of Chinese Civil War between KMT and CPC. CPC used weapons abandoned by the Japanese to fight.  
1949 October: CPC proclaimed the founding of PRC, with its capital Beijing.    
1949 October: Soviet Government recognised the new PRC. Meanwhile, UN maintained that ROC, with KMT as ruling party, was still legitimate.  
1949 December: KMT retreated to the island of Taiwan, and proclaimed Taipei as the temporary capital of ROC (Mainland China + Taiwan).  
1949-1971: UN maintained that ROC was de facto “China”, with capital as Taipei. It was the only “China” represented in UN.  
1971: ROC lost its seat in the UN to PRC.  
  
Then this part onwards is what most people already know, and are passing judgements.  
  
Question: Why didn’t Mao invade Taiwan, in order to have an actual total invasion of ROC (Mainland China + Taiwan)? They have only invaded and stayed in Mainland China, while claiming to have founded PRC.  
  
There are several answers for it, of which the most compelling ones are: (a) Mao never actually considered Taiwan (the island) part of Mainland China; (b) In actual fact, there were plans to invade Taiwan in 1950, but it was aborted by Mao.  
  
This supports the admission that Taiwan, as a geographical boundary, has never been invaded/overtaken by CPC.  
   
A few other things peppered into it to make it more complicated: KMT were corrupted and authoritarian, and wanted to take back Mainland China as part of ROC; USA had vested interest in protecting more land from being invaded by communists; Taiwan’s own indigenous groups were resistant to KMT at first, viewing them as conquerors in liberators’ guise, etc etc.  
  
I might have missed a lot of points out, but this is the gist of my understanding and my own conclusion that I don’t see why PRC should even dare to propose a reunification One China policy when in the first place, they didn’t manage to invade/conquer Taiwan.

> Why didn’t Mao invade Taiwan

CCP didn't invade Taiwan because of the Korean War. You can easily find many literature on this. After the Korean War, Beijing pretty much loss their opportunity as the KMT govt consolidated the island and also improve their military with the help of the US. Meanwhile China has its own domestic problems to worry about

The fact that the civil war technically have never ended should be more than enough reason for China to take back Taiwan. On top of that, its mainly Taiwan's own fault really. They could have declared independence a long time ago but insisted they were part of Greater China and was the legit ruler of the whole of China until everyone else switched sides. 

While we can argue all we want about the reason and jusitifications, at the end of the day it doesnt change the fact that as far as the UN and most countries in the world is concern, Taiwan is officially still part of China and by extension should be reporting their cases to WHO as part of China. Them not doing so is not China's fault, it's their fault for playing politicals. You don't see Catelonia insisting on reporting their cases separate from Spain do you?

=== Author: Zukiff===

=== Author: confused_cereal===
Ummm, it's not about linguistics per se, but more so an entirely different legal/ethical/moral framework. The easiest way to get a feel of this is to bring this up to your \*close\* PRC friends (not colleagues and certainly not strangers) in preferably a private space and measure their response. 

Theres a reason why things like HK, Taiwan, and now, the nine-dashed line matter. These issues straddle geopolitics \*and\* the cultural identity and common beliefs of the typical Chinese national.

=== Author: kanteater===
Again, I respectfully disagree that UN's change in definition of China (from ROC to PRC) is a fair one, which is what I'm arguing. It shouldn't be a taken fact at face value. You are saying that this fact is a fact and it is an indestructible, undeniable fact, ergo everything else in the equation is correct. I am saying that fundamentally, this fact is wrong. ROC is not part of China, geographically, politically, economically, metaphysically, AND historically. When Japan gave up sovereignty of Taiwan the island, they did not give it back to PRC under CPC rule, they gave it back to ROC under KMT rule.   
  
I agree that the KMT screwed up in that they were initially too greedy in proclaiming the whole of Mainland China + Taiwan island as their territory with the capital Taipei. But this does not dilute the fact that Mao intended to invade Taiwan, but didn't and couldn't. This fact alone is admission to me that Mao knows Taiwan island has to be invaded first in order to reunify with Mainland China + PRC + CPC.  
  
The Korean war diversion was his own strategic mistake. It is largely understood that CPC army was also not capable enough on sea to conquer Taiwan island and chase KMT out anyway. CPC made a mistake. KMT also made a mistake. What makes one person's mistake (not strong enough to actually conquer and take back the island, kick KMT out and rule it) more negligible than the other's (silly enough to wait too long to not declare independence)?  
  
Edit: I think my final conclusion for the day is... Boy am I glad Singapore had a clean breakup with Malaysia.

=== Author: FitCranberry===
this is when you know youre grasping at straws

=== Author: calicotrinket===
Yeah, it's difficult to describe an entirely different mindset. They see that Taiwan independence threatens their sovereignty  - and whilst they bash imperialism by Western countries, they are doing the exact same thing - HK and Macau are effectively colonies with limited self-governance.

=== Author: Zukiff===
When Japan gave up Indochina to France and Singapore back to the British they didn't care if we would gain independence later either

What you think and what is, is 2 different thing

In a perfect world, Taiwan would be recognize as an independent nation. We don't live in a perfect world and what you think, really isn't going to change that fact

=== Author: Zukiff===
Yeah funny how people have grand delusional views of how things should be instead of how things actually is. Like thinking Taiwan is a sovereign nation despite how no country in the world actually recognize a country call Taiwan exists

> # A general election during Covid-19 outbreak disadvantages S’pore’s opposition even more

> On March 13, the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) report was released.

> This means that the General Election will likely be called soon. Real soon.

> Election in the time of Covid-19?

> The release of the report comes amidst a flurry of developments on the Covid-19 front.

> With an increasing number of confirmed cases, the government has announced a slew of enhanced precautionary measures from Stay-Home Notices, travel restrictions and advisories.

> Just days before the EBRC report was out, Gan Kim Yong, the minister for health and co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, announced that all ticketed events with 250 or more participants are to be cancelled or deferred.

> Owners of dining venues were also advised to reduce close contact between patrons.

> With such social distancing measures, it may seem counterintuitive to hold the election anytime soon, since the process of political campaigning and polling typically involves interaction with large groups of people.

> In response to the release of the EBRC report, opposition parties have also put out statements urging the government to focus on the battle against Covid-19.

> The Progress Singapore Party also told Mothership that it hopes Singapore can focus on the containment of Covid-19 for now.

> Citing the lack of urgency for an election — given the current parliamentary term ends in April 2021 — the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) also called on the government to “categorically rule out the GE”, until it is clear we are seeing the “tail-end of the virus spread”.

> The SDP added that this would show that “the PAP is putting its own interests over the people’s safety”.

> The Workers’ Party (WP), the only opposition party with parliament seats, urged the government to “take caution and exercise judiciousness” in calling for a GE.

> In its statement on March 15, WP said that the government’s decision “must be one that is in the the best interests of Singapore, our democracy and the public health of Singaporeans”.

> The PAP seeking a “fresh” mandate

> But there may be a good reason for the PAP to call for GE sooner than later.

> Firstly, it could be a way for the PAP to secure a strong mandate to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.

> PM Lee hinted at this on March 14, saying that the election date will depend on what will best see Singapore through the Covid-19 crisis.

> He said that Singapore has two choices:

> “Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that. Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.”

> Opposition disadvantaged on several fronts

> Some analysts that Today spoke to, however, have explained how calling for the GE now will disadvantage the opposition.

> We are in (heading into?) crises times

> Historically, the ruling party tends to see landslide victories in times of great global uncertainty and crises.

> For instance, the 2001 General Election, which took place months after the September 11 attacks, saw the PAP winning with a overwhelming 75 per cent vote share.

> Incidentally, 2001 was also the first election held in Singapore after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997.

> Currently, Singapore (and the world) is facing a health pandemic on a global scale, and the threat of a financial recession looms.

> The virus crisis is likely to be a political boon for the ruling party as Singapore heads into a deeply uncertain future — understandably, voters do not want to “rock the boat” during such times.

> The ruling party is further advantaged by its management of Covid-19, which has earned praise from even the World Health Organisation for our containment efforts.

> Infectious disease specialist Dale Fisher, who has also been involved with the World Health Organisation’s Global Outbreak Alert & Response Network (GOARN) for 15 years, also said:

> “Overall, internationally, I don’t believe the world is ready for this outbreak. But Singapore is.”

> Privileges those with great resources

> Secondly, Covid-19 will inadvertently affect how rallies are run.

> And this is likely to advantage parties with greater resources.

> For instance, analysts that spoke to Today suggested that event organisers would have to implement temperature screening measures, book multiple venues to ensure adequate segregation of participants, and also consider live-streaming debates on social media.

> This would likely result in huge logistical costs, which disadvantages opposition parties with fewer resources.

> Nature of opposition rallies

> Going digital also fundamentally alters the way politicians interact with electors, and hence, alters the entire campaigning experience in a way that may disadvantage the opposition.

> Opposition party rallies have historically seen much larger crowds than those organised by the PAP.

> But what does crowd size really mean?

> There’s the argument that more people at opposition party rallies means more votes for them.

> But crowds may not necessarily reflect voter sentiment either.

> Nevertheless, rallies are still a crucial mode in which the opposition canvases for votes from swing voters.

> These undecided voters are more likely to attend rallies and spend more time reading up on party campaigns before polling.

> And needless to say, physically standing in a crowd and listening to powerful speeches during a rally is vastly different from watching a video uploaded to your Facebook feed.

> Yes, this disadvantages the opposition. But this isn’t new.

> Terence Lee said in a commentary published by CNA that Covid-19 is the “elephant in the room that may be the ultimate game-changer”,

> But even without this external crisis facing us, the attainment of the PAP’s effective political dominance in Singapore means that the opposition in Singapore has been historically disadvantaged.

> In Is the PAP here to stay?, Associate Professor Bilveer Singh elaborated on how performance legitimacy of the PAP, coupled with entrenchment of its power, has made it difficult for the opposition to replace this ruling party.

> Since the PAP has attained parliamentary dominance since 1959, they have successfully met various challenges to secure economic and social stability.

> They have since then also secured control over political and non-political organisations in Singapore.

> The party has also engineered the rules of engagement — seen in the case of gerrymandering, where electoral boundaries are carved out by the ruling party to better their chances of increasing vote share.

> Lee pointed out that the three SMCs (Sengkang West, Punggol East and Fengshan) that have disappeared in this year’s EBRC report have been “strong stomping ground for WP candidates since 2011”.

> We see the effects of politics in everyday life as well, in something as banal (but important, nevertheless) as lift upgrading.

> Workers Party former-NCMP Yee Jenn Jong had argued that the PAP has been subtly (and sometimes openly) crafting the narrative that support for the opposition would adversely affect Singapore’s well-being and stability.

> In 2011, a university student asked PM Lee why opposition wards are not treated as well as PAP wards — namely, PAP wards being prioritised when it comes to resource allocation and upgrading programmes.

> PM Lee said:

> “There has to be a distinction.

Holding an election like every other during an outbreak amounts to voter suppression.

To get a proper turnout, they need to find methods like mail-in voting, staggered over several days, etc.

SDP is smart to sound this out. If election still gets held, they can harp on this to say PAP is irresponsible, and get a few votes for themselves. If election gets delayed, it's good for them too.

Copypasta from a while back. I ran some numbers using GE2015 data to determine the min number of votes to maintain a majority. Haven't run the numbers for GE2020/2021 yet, but it shouldn't differ too much.

>Addendum: One more thing worth pointing out is that even with a reduction in the popular vote, the ruling party can still retain a parliamentary majority simply by not losing any of the bigger GRCs. Based on GE15 statistics, only 29.5% of the popular vote is required. The PAP isn't losing its mandate anytime soon.

Slightly discouraged by some of the cases (264 in particular). I really dont think that we should be encouraging medical tourism for COVID-19 cases. Hope that the government would do something about all these people coming in specifically for treatment (someone who came in on 16 March and is tested positive on 17 March is HIGHLY suspect imo). They should really get a black mark on their travel record for doing so.

Let’s be mentally prepared for :

2. Deaths

I wonder why we have yet to limit entry from people who do not possess WP/LTVP/PR. All it takes is for one irresponsible imported case to wander around and we'll have a new cluster on our hands.

=== Author: sjioldboy===
The majority of the recent spike are locals (citizens, PRs, work-pass holders) who went overseas & came back infected. It's currently about 60% of new cases now, while sick tourists comprise only about 11%. 

So the urgency is to dissuade those here from traveling abroad, whether for work, study or leisure. 

But given how the virus incubates across time, our new 14-day SHN disincentive as well as Malaysia's own travel ban won't likely decrease imported cases until 1-2 weeks from now.

We aren't anymore. Remember that as of 0000hrs today, short-term visitors who are nationals of ASEAN countries (of course ASEAN, we wouldn't single out a single ASEAN country or anything!) now require a health declaration with approval from MOH to be permitted to enter Singapore.

The kicker? MOH has [declared](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/health-clearance) it takes anywhere between 14 - 21 days for all health clearance applications to be processed. I think it's safe to say that most people are not gonna fuck around for 14 - 21 days just in the hopes of seeking COVID-19 treatment in Singapore, and even then, MOH could just say: ""Denied.""

Yes there is no more medical tourism for these period after the 2 indo cases. I think the government have made an address on this. Anyone who came from ASEAN region need to stay in their hotel for 14 days. They also need to submit a medical record to the Singapore embassy in their respective country before coming over.

2nd, most of the new cases are imported, lockdown would not help because the world at large has yet to reach its peak. If they keep coming in after the lockdown, the lockdown would be for nothing that's why a travel restriction makes more sense because local spread is not a major issue

He was in Italy during the spike in cases and when govts issued travel advisories (4 Mar for Singapore), making him a high risk asymptomatic individual.

I think there are guidelines on how to separate suspect or even confirm cases within a household. As to whether it is likely it can be carried out fully depends on the household and size of the family, but guidelines are available. E.g. which areas to disinfect, frequency, separation of toilet, etc.

=== Author: lord_of_tits===
Yes today... but yesterday sg air had 3 additional flights so Indo’s can beat the quarantine measures. SQ was charging 1000sgd 1 way from jakarta and the flights were all full. And that was not including their hourly flights they have. Not including all the other airlines that were packed out. Not including all the people who flooded batam to get into sg by ferry. And off course not including the other Asean countries.

=== Author: realpdd===
I said soft lockdown for a reason. The cases are clearly rising, faster than when it first surfaced and from more different countries. There are more and more unlinked cases.

I am not saying people cant go out. Even in Malaysia people can still go out. But when I see people packed like sardines in queues to clubs or at bars (a lot of them seemingly expats or tourists), it's very scary to think that it could potentially spread through that. All these things are unnecessary when there's a very contagious virus going around.

When Covid first started coming in Singapore I was in the camp of things will die down by April and precautions shouldn't be too exteme. 

But look at whats happening in Italy and Spain where their healthcare system is suddenly being overloaded and what's rumored to be possibly happening in US, UK, and Indonesia where it is believed there are ton more undetected cases and healthcare systems could potentially overwhelmed. Its very clear that drastic actions should be taken ASAP to at the very least, slow the potential spread before it gets uncontrallable.

Its not the virus that is scary, but the healthcare system's ability to cope with it.

Either that or mass test everyone like the Koreans.

I think it's unavoidable that yesterday there would be a rush of people trying to get in (and today, a rush of people trying to get out of Malaysia). Such is the nature of lockdowns and travel bans.

Without a doubt the number of daily cases will be high over the next three weeks (initially imported, later local), but fingers crossed the number of daily cases will start dropping from the peak after that. If we can reach February levels again 6 weeks from now I think we would all have done a good job (that includes everyone who's being responsible with social distancing and personal hygiene).

But until then, it's definitely going to get much, much worse before it gets better again. Not just here but throughout the globe.

Coz a China style lockdown is too expensive and too unpopular to implement, anyone doing that will definitely lose the next election

Korea style testing everyone only works if you can get enough test kits and have the organisational skills, the Ang Moh spent the last 2 months bashing China instead of getting ready so this for is not even an option

Singapore style contact tracing and isolation only works because we are small

Basically all the methods that works are not workable for them so they are being creative. Worst case scenario, just blame China. The US is already doing that by insisting on calling it the Wuhan/foreign/China virus

Just a point of clarification, out of the 23 cases reported today, there were 10 Singaporeans, 3 PRs, and 10 foreign nationals. If by ""foreigners"" you mean ""tourists"", then sure there's possibly 4 cases (248, 256, 262, 264) who could be tourists, but foreigners and tourists are not interchangeable terms. Also I don't actually see many comments on this thread lambasting foreigners for ""over running the hospitals"", most are complaining about people who are still travelling the world despite the pandemic or going to work even after reporting the onset of symptoms.

>Most of these are not imported cases.

This was what you said. Which is not true. Most of these new cases **are** imported. If you had earlier said that foreigners should not be blamed because a majority of the cases are from people who live in SG, then that's a point worth arguing. But by questioning why the false equivalences you've made are now causing you to get downvoted, it suggests that you might still not understand that an imported case does not equate to that individual being a foreigner. It simply means that that individual more likely than not contracted the virus overseas before bringing it over to SG. Their nationality has no bearing on them being classified as an imported case.

Yes, which is where the touching of surfaces come in. I've seen this study. Don't touch surfaces. You think you breath in the virus cells is it? That's aerosal transmission and nothing indicates that's the case. Even the china doctors who suggested such a thing backed away from it

And Bill gates is a doctor of virology? Wow, never knew that

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
Bill Gates has been very involved in virology for years now. He warned about the world being unready for the next outbreak four years ago during a Ted Talk ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b\_wyiwI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwI)), and was involved in Event 201, a pandemic exercise held a few months ago to highlight the potential problems that an outbreak could bring ([http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/index.html](http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/index.html)).

As for aerosol transmission, there's this:

MOH acknowledging that aerosol transmission was possible: ([https://mothership.sg/2020/02/aerosol-transmission-caveats-moh/](https://mothership.sg/2020/02/aerosol-transmission-caveats-moh/)).

This updated March 13 study which said it was still plausible: [https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-can-spread-as-an-aerosol.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-can-spread-as-an-aerosol.html)

And the fact that WHO is considering airborne precautions for the medical staff since it remains a possibility:

Oh yeah, like I'm very involved with animals so I'm a vet

If MOH is acknowledging it's possible, why aren't you linking to MOH. There's a difference between saying this could happen and this is how it's happening with asymptomatic people. You doomers need to chill

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
> Oh yeah, like I'm very involved with animals so I'm a vet 

Bill Gate provides significant funding for disease research  through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations, so he's been working closely with disease experts for years and would know what he's talking about. Like I said, he already warned years ago about the world being unprepared for a pandemic and was heavily involved in Event 201. He knows what he's talking about because he has plenty of experts to talk to about this.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
So WHO needs to chill as well and that they're overreacting with considering airborne precautions for the medical staff? Ok then.

> If MOH is acknowledging it's possible, why aren't you linking to MOH.  

That's like asking why people chose to link the Straits Times article or the Channel News Asia article instead of the MOH press release article. I linked the mothership article because I remember seeing it there.

He really wouldn't.

Considering, not implemented means they don't think so

=== Author: evilplushie===
Also, read your own damn article properly lor. 

""The virus is transmitted through droplets, or little bits of liquid, mostly through sneezing or coughing, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, told reporters during a virtual news conference on Monday. “When you do an aerosol-generating procedure like in a medical care facility, you have the possibility to what we call aerosolize these particles, which means they can stay in the air a little bit longer.”

""

Oh no, if we do an aerosol generating procedure most asymptomatic people won't go through, we MIGHT aerosolize the same respiratory particles I've been mentioning before. This is different from I breath on person, person falls sick

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
""Considering"" means they might implement because it's a possibility. It doesn't mean they don't think so.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
You do realise that aerosol transmission can occur from toilet flushing, right? One of the earlier articles that I linked talked about that.  


That some Hong Kongers were infected in the same building on different floors through the pipes already suggest that aerosol transmission is possible. 

And there's also this study where they found the virus on air outlet fans, "" suggesting that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and  deposited on equipment such as vents."" [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762692?appId=scweb](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762692?appId=scweb)

=== Author: evilplushie===
Read your own article

WHO is talking about a specific incident of what MIGHT happen in a medical facility with aerosol generating atmosphere

=== Author: evilplushie===
That's transmission from fecal matter. And you share the same area as a person who flushes the toilet at the same time? 

And yes, much more likely they were affected by aerosol transmission, an unproven method than by touching lift buttons or common surfaces, a proven method. Much big brain you

Also, there's no chance the virus on those fans couldn't have been from people coughing either.

You don't need to be there at the same time since it can stay up for some hours.

And not the first time it happened either.  
[https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spread-building-pipes.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spread-building-pipes.html)

The most recent study already said that the virus could be there for up to three hours.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
>Also, there's no chance the virus on those fans couldn't have been from people coughing either.

The study itself already said this.

>Swabs taken from the air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting  that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and  deposited on equipment such as vents.

A person can cough, and a fan can let it travel further than usual. That would still be counted as aerosolisation.

In European and middle east countries, schools are shut down. Any gatherings or events of over 100 people are banned. Mosques, Churches, club, schools are shut down.

If you gonna claim ""government didn't say not to travel"", then wouldn't it be a case of you being reliant on what the government say and contradicting your point about how we rely too much on the government?

We aren't letting our guard down, most of the new cases have been IMPORTED meaning TRAVELLED which you did so in reality, what you did traveling to Indonesia would make you more at risk of getting covid-19.

Please be more socially responsible yourself before criticizing things. Thanks.

=== Author: flabberwabber===
Eh, you’re not being logical here though. 

Let’s examine:


1. The spikes so far were mostly imported cases. 

Do you expect the government to deny entry to every single person that has a right to enter Singapore? I’m talking about Singaporeans who need to return home because they don’t have medical benefits when being stuck in a foreign land with a government who has *really* dropped the ball. And mathematically while there are hundreds of thousands of people clear immigration on a daily basis, the probability of them being infected with covid is actually very low. 

You cannot prevent people from wanting to come back to SG when the government announces a restriction on travel. It’s their right as a Singaporean to be in SG and get their medical benefits here. If it were you who happened to be overseas, you would probably wish the same. 




2. Imported cases vs unlinked community spread

Since the majority are imported cases, the contact tracing is actually comparatively easy and the spread is more containable than unlinked community spread. 

As the waves of Singaporeans and work/eligible visa holders start coming back to Singapore, the number will increase, definitely, but the *true* number of (undetected) cases will not exponentially increase. 



3. Close the borders and schools and every damn thing!????!!??

No you can’t, for now. Mathematically, the probability of community spread is still not at the levels of the other countries we see in the news. There is a very huge economic burden from shutting everything down, and we shouldn’t go there if we don’t have to. 

Besides, the *majority* of people are acting in the “correct” way and doing their best to prevent disease / meltdown of resources (food, toilet paper, masks) in the country, so there is no need for a lockdown. 

Lockdown is necessary only when there is a huge number of undetected cases (China), and/or the people are generally not treating the virus seriously (Italians, for example, and the people organizing and attending these 10,000-people mosque gatherings).



TL;DR:

- You can’t stop people from coming back to SG or from behaving in an irresponsible way
- Spike is still not due to unknown community spread, so no need to lockdown
- Lockdown is only for large number of undetected cases and/or for irresponsible populace behavior


Edit:

And everybody wearing a mask is only useful when there are a large number of undetected cases, which means there is huge community spread. That is, China (epicenter), South Korea (cult), and since you said Indonesia... yeah because we all knew they didn’t really have “zero” cases.

Real question, how do we realistically do the whole social distancing here. Every morning my commute is still very much shoulder to shoulder stuck in a tube.

There are some areas that they have done exceptionally well and other areas where it was poorly carried out.

**Exceptionally Well** : The entire medical process from testing to treatment and recovery. Kudos to the medical professionals

**Exceptionally Well** : Contact tracing, very impressive

**Really Poor:** The management of their grassroots to set examples or be role does. There are 2 cases - the Bukit Batok MP who organised dinner for the elderly and the PA/RC group who organised dinner at SAFRA Jurong even though it was not done by PA.

**Really Poor:**  Continuing to allow Indonesians thru for days via plane and ferries despite knowing that were seeking treatment here and abusing the system. .

**Really Poor:** Stopping the transmission chain - failure to execute social distancing, schools remaining open, people continue to gather at events, slow and poor messaging.

**Really Poor:** Daily status update starts with discharge numbers rather than new cases. This is schoolboy psychology hoping to focus on the positive. People want to know if the threat is growing.

=== Author: eliseusmoo===
I agree to a certain extent that we are indeed getting complacent. It's because of the ""over-praise"" from different sources and the constant high/fast rate of recovery of those infected, coupled with government's constant reassurances and whatnot that leads people to think that Singapore has it all under control. Just the fact that the wealthy and powerful are flying in from different parts of the world to our small nation in hopes of receiving treatment already says alot about that.

But what most of the people still don't understand is that it doesn't matter if we have it under control ***currently*** or not.  It's not SG vs CoVid-19, it's World vs CoVid-19. And if we think that the virus will not mutate or evolve in the near future and that our medical facilities/abilities are sufficient to withstand whatever's coming next then seriously that naivety is gonna cost us.

What's happening in Italy and the other western counterparts could've easily been us had it not been for the quick reaction of the government agencies and ***our own*** kiasism. The early testings and quarantines do help to isolate and slow down the spread but lately it seems that even though as the number of cases increase but because there hasn't been any mortality, people has been treating it as;

""aiya it's just a over-glorified flu, if kena already i young can survive. And even if the older generation kena  also don't need to worry because SG health services sibei solid 1, see so far not even a single case of death in our country yet scared for what?""

It's a very sad thing to say but until someone dies from this in our country, people will only be more lax in the upcoming days despite the daily sharp increase.

=== Author: Pandacius===
I have to agree with you. Singapore was extremely proactive was banning China. We were the first to do so - and that saved our asses for a month.

But when it came to Europe - we dragged our asses. Is it the white-worshiping complex? Heck, even when Italy for exceeded the infection rate of China per capita, we still decided only to ban northern Italy and allow everyone else in. And American returnees did not need to do any self-quarantines till yesterday.

Heck Australia/New Zealand institute the global SHM 1-2 weeks before us.

I agree with you that knowing fully well that the march school holidays were coming, the government should have stopped people from travelling overseas during this time. Now, they can’t physically stop people from leaving the country, but they should have slapped people with SHNs right from the very start, rather than waiting till tomorrow. 

As it stands, school reopens next week, and we have students returning and congregating after a week of god knows where they have been and what they have done. 

Telling people to not travel is as good as not saying anything at all.

I think there’s many perspectives and not just black and white ‘to ban or not to ban’. Back then, it was a smart move to ban China, the epicenter of transmissions. Yes, our tourism might suffer but they’re still tourists coming from many other parts of the world. Simple cost-benefit analysis, makes total sense. Plus, they might have thought it would only be restricted to China, banning them would stop transmission around the world. But once it went out of hand and starts infecting the rest of the world, you can’t shut yourself from the world indefinitely. Cost-benefit analysis, harder to justify the travel restrictions as it would have a huge impact on our economy. However, it’s now clearly gone way out of hand, hence travel restrictions have a higher benefit to cost. Wouldn’t immediately jump to the conclusion of ‘white-worshipping complex’ lol

And less than 2 percent of Singapore is infected. The government needs to base it's measures on objective data like the total amount of cases and the rate of increase, the source of increase, and not wishy washy feelings like ""they can do more"".

If you can weigh the odds and travel to Batam I don't get why it is that difficult to understand that the government is doing the same when deciding on policy. Unless of course you think that balancing the odds is a special privilege that you get while the rest of us needs to do more.

That’s why there are currently restrictions in place to “dissuade” short term visitors (SHN, reject) and medical tourists (payable healthcare).

You have to consider the long haul political and diplomatic impact too from actually making a “all the people from X country cannot come in” versus “you can come but SHN”. Those with large number of cases (with probability of larger number of undetected cases) are rejected, those with low number of cases get SHN. 

I think we are also running with the expectation that this pandemic cannot be contained until a vaccine or cure is developed, so we are just flattening the curve here.

I completely agree with the China ban at the start. It did us a lock of good,

I also agree that we can't shut ourselves form the whole world.

But we should look objectively and reassess. Where is the most new infections per capita coming now?

China, of example, now has a virus contained outside Wuhan. Their rate of new infections per capita is now one of the lowest in the world. Meanwhile they have a mandatory 14 day quarantine for any visitors - a much more strongly enforced one than SG. Similarly Taiwan/Hong Kong are equally good.

I would say its time to close borders to EU/US, but tentatively open borders to China. We review this policy every week. As like as we can keep border to one of EU/US/China open, we will be economically okay.

=== Author: Pandacius===
Yeah, I'm really mad at this. China's new infections per capita is actually one of the lowest in the world now - and has been for the last 2 weeks, Maybe PAP thinks with all the China-hate, banning China is politically easier than the west?

But man, the last 2 weeks has seen scary growth in Europe/US. I am afraid thae next 2 weeks are going to get worse :(. I hope this doesn't overwhelm our health care system if we get 50+ infections per day for about 14 days.

No one is blaming the government. I'm just saying more could be done.

Anyway, you are assuming there's case in Batam just because there are more probably more cases in Indonesia that's still hidden, which I'm not denying. But you are ASSUMING that there are in Batam.  The government has never said that imported cases are specifically from Batam. So you're assuming.

Just so you know, Indonesia is a huge ass country and if you actually did your research, most of the cases are in Java itself. I didn't go there for shopping or a holiday. It's to meet my own wife. Plus, I wore face mask throughout and carried a small hand sanitizer in my pocket. Don't assume like you know what I did when you clearly don't.

And I'm not covid-19 positive and i bet none on my ferry are positive for it. How can I be the problem when I'm not positive for it. Makes zero sense. I didn't get infected so no one got infected by my actions. Zero. And this was before the SHN so how am i being socially irresponsible.

No. Initially the advisory was to defer travel to SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, ITALY, IRAN, GERMANY, CHINA and UK. So you're wrong.

No denying, there are of course many Singaporeans who don't even practice standard hygiene such as wearing masks and washing their hands often but being on reddit often and following the Covid-19 outbreak closely, I'm not like that.

Did you not read my reply earlier, i clearly said I'm not blaming the government. Unless you disagree.
I said more can be done. Its too bad you too can't accept my opinion. Still didn't admit you were wrong regarding the travel advisory part. NICE.

> # ‘Sufficient flexibility and buffer’ in Singapore’s capacity to care for COVID-19 patients: Gan Kim Yong

> SINGAPORE: Singapore’s healthcare system has “sufficient flexibility and buffer” to manage the expected increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday (Mar 18), who also said that the outbreak could last beyond the year.

> “I would say there is sufficient flexibility and buffer to allow us to manage the expected number of cases coming in,” said Mr Gan as he addressed reporters at a press conference.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Mr Gan noted that the travel restrictions and social distancing measures implemented are efforts to reduce the number of cases at any point in time to ensure that our healthcare capacity is “not only able to cope but has sufficient buffer capacity to allow us to meet the expected increase in numbers”.

> 

> On Wednesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) also advised Singaporeans to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect amid a heightened risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

> Singapore reported 47 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, 33 of which are imported - mostly returning Singapore residents who were infected overseas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Nineteen of them had travelled to Europe, while six had been in North America. Six other cases been to ASEAN nations while another case travelled beyond ASEAN to other parts of Asia.

> The remaining imported case had travelled to both Europe and North America.

> Nine other cases are linked to previous cases while five are currently unlinked, MOH added.

> 

> “We do expect to see a higher number than this in time to come. Therefore, it is important for us to always bear in mind that while our healthcare capacity is sufficient, we have planned for it, but we should never be complacent and take it for granted,” said Mr Gan.

> “We must do all we can to manage the number of cases so that we aim to reduce the total number in any day, the peak number of any day, so that our healthcare capacity can still manage them.”

> 

> Mr Gan also stressed that the peak of the virus should be delayed as long as possible, spreading out cases “so that we have sufficient capacity” for them.

> “But by deferring the peak it also may mean that the outbreak lasts longer. Because instead of everyone coming down with COVID-19, we stretch it out,” he added.

> The potential for the number of COVID-19 cases to rise so significantly that it overwhelms Singapore’s healthcare capacity is “something that we are always mindful of"", said MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak.

> “That has not happened yet. And we do have plans that allow us then to expand our capacity and capability accordingly as needed,” said Dr Mak.

> “The travel restrictions are there for us to control importation of cases and therefore allow the number of new cases as they emerge to occur at a rate that we can comfortably handle.”

> There are various plans already in place for the capacity to be expanded, said Mr Gan, adding that he visited Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Wednesday to learn more about their contingency plans.

> This would include converting some normal wards into isolation wards or COVID-19 wards. Mr Gan also noted that MOH has ongoing collaborations with private hospitals to possibly send some non-COVID-19 patients there to preserve capacity in public hospitals.

> 

> It was also announced on Wednesday that Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Friday will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

> Singapore residents and long-term pass holders entering from the Hubei province in China will serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the SHN, for example, a hotel booking covering the entire period or a place of residence that they or their family members own.

> People under SHN will have to stay at their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.

> ""The existing measures which apply to all inbound travellers, such as requiring those who exhibit fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness to undergo a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoints, will continue to apply,"" MOH said.

> As announced previously, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.

> Explaining why the number of confirmed imported cases is expected to rise, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said the recent rise in numbers is from people who arrived in Singapore one to two weeks ago.

> Citing the example of the chartered flights from Wuhan on Jan 30 and Feb 9, Mr Wong noted that “quite a number” of Singaporeans on those flights were infected.

> “That was one city. Now we have many cities all over the world in Europe, in America where the virus is circulating and spreading quite quickly.”

> He noted that while there are still commercial flights available, there is a chance that many returnees will be infected.

> “This recent rise in numbers are people who came back one to two weeks ago. That’s why even with these measures we think the number of cases will continue to rise and even beyond.”

> 

> Responding to questions about how long the outbreak could last, Mr Gan noted that the outbreak in Singapore would largely depend on the situation around the world. He also said it could last beyond the year.

> “Therefore we have to prepare for the long haul. The measures that we put in place, we need to think about how can we adjust it to a level that we can sustain for many months, not just for the next week or so,"" said Mr Gan.

Dear Singapore government,

Thank you so much for not being a screw-up like the UK. Do you know they cut train services so now their trains are so packed? And can you imagine the poor nurses who have to wake up extra early to go to work and go home very late just because of transport issues because of that?

Please keep treating our cleaners and transport workers and grocery store worker and so on extra well. I don't think anyone will protest if you give the nurses and healthcare workers extra bonus now so they can maybe have food delivered when they are too tired to cook at home.

Arghh so fucking annoyed at my family and I need a place to vent. We have just been issued a stay at home notice and they *insist* on breaking it. No manner of logic and ethics can convince them otherwise. And guess what, they're breaking it to go to the wet market and NTUC. And it's not a one time thing, they plan to visit my grandmother tomorrow. WTF. And my dad plans on his bi-weekly trip to NTUC because he's too cheap for redmart.

When I tried to tell them otherwise, their logic was ""government won't check one la"" or ""even if they check, they won't check first day"". THAT'S NOT THE FRIGGIN POINT OF A SHN. 

And yes, they're your classic boomers.

* Tsundere Sergeant who isn’t afraid to knock MC down for every mistake he does. Oh and is vulgar as fuck.
* Kuudere LTA PC who basically taichis her work to the Tsundere Sergeant. Can also double as Senpai archtype.
* Bonus Route: Female MO who got posted to CPMB before and did medical checkup on alot of enlistees there so you can hazard a pretty good guess what her archetype is...

i have a qn - i'm going to be starting uni this august so i'm not an official student yet but i have already completed early matriculation and gotten my student card. For now i'm working part time and my transport fees have doubled so I thought of applying for student concession. However when i tried applying through the SimplyGo app it asks for an ID number (is it NRIC or my student card number ?) and it told me my information was not found on their database. 

Anyone has any idea how i can apply for bus concession? thank you!

Follow-up on my comment yesterday:

So I went down to SLS and checked out a few stores, dynacore/pcthemes/tradepac/fuwell, and got their prices. After comparing, they are all roughly about the same price range, $1.9-2k. However that price is actually also roughly the same as the one which I was going to get from Aftershock so major dilemma now; should I just order prebuilt?

Also saw this deal online, seems pretty legit for $1.78k except for the SSD which is kinda low at 256gb. Thoughts?

I have long had the view that food delivery services were inflating the economy frivolously - why get a middle-person involved in a transaction when you can complete it directly? Once in a while would have been acceptable, but making it a habit multiple times a week was 'wasteful' to me.

Now that more people are under quarantine, Stay-Home-Notice or working long hours on the front lines, I can better appreciate such services.

From the Western media that I have been consuming, there have been increased pleas to support local businesses through such services because their footfall has been greatly affected by recent events. I wonder what constitutes a 'local business' whose very survival might hinge on customers procuring their products through delivery services.

It is comforting that the delivery networks that have been built and consolidated over the years can be utilised in such a way to ensure the continuity and survival of businesses and workers.

With so many imported cases now, I wouldn't be surprised when the number of unlinked cases also increases by a lot.

We are letting in people may be infected but yet to be tested into the country. Who knows what they could be doing after entering Singapore? Taking public transport? Walking around Changi Airport and other crowded areas in Singapore. They could also unknowingly infect their family members who could then infect the community... 

We really need to stop letting visitors into the country. Otherwise, please enforce a mandatory testing and quarantine for all visitors and only release them when they are tested negative.

I don’t care about the downvotes, but I care about the stupid mentality of many on this subreddit. On the post about the 2 deaths from covid-19, I asked a simple question- “wonder if this means Doscorn Red?” Then I got heavily downvoted. Why? I’m sorry that I don’t check this subreddit enough to know it’s a commonly asked question I’m sorry that I don’t know the requirements for Doscorn Red to be implemented.

It’s a new development for covid-19, so I asked. And many people in real life have been speculating if and when Doscorn Red will be triggered. It’s not a crazy question. But I guess you have to be very smart and well informed here. I really really love how welcoming this subreddit is. Downvote this all you want too.

I think it’s illegal to not adhere to the SHN, can get fined or go to to jail one. I think la

Regardless even if it’s not it’s also quite socially irresponsible of your family leh. Should legit report, even if it feels bad to sabo your parents. If you’re aware and you’re not doing anything just because they’re your family that makes you socially irresponsible too.

=== Author: x1243===
Do they know they will go to jail?

=== Author: mianbaooo===
>their logic was ""government won't check one la"" or ""even if they check, they won't check first day""

my colleague is serving her SHN and she got checked on twice on the first day. you can let them know the checking is random and if they get caught, they're liable for a fine of up to $10k, jail term of up to 6 months, or both. hopefully, that'll scare them into not breaking it.

Rather than being anxious, try to frame the point of view to be mindful of the disease. Anxiety makes you fear things that are coming and might happen; mindfulness frames it to consider what can be done , what can be further done but to still accept things which can't be done but have been prepared for as much as possible. When things does happen, respond as much as you can, learn what can be further done and move on. Slight shift in how you perceive your thoughts, emotions and logic but personally helps with ensuring my own mental health and emotional stability.

That much for a GTX 1660?! Seriously not worth.

And if you're spending that much, a 256 GB SSD is just insulting in 2020.

Please don't get that prebuilt on the link

=== Author: ninjadoge420===
Also I just checked your pcpartpicker link on your profile. I feel it is seriously inbalanced. Let me explain:

Nobody should be buying Intel CPUs at this time; AMD is king since their Ryzen launch. You can still overclock \[the Ryzen CPUs\] like your chosen i7 9700K, but you can't anyway because you got a B365 board? And why would you want to spend that much money for a build just to get only a GTX 1660 Super? For that price of the system at around $1500 (USD) or in SGD, near $2000, you can get a RTX 2060 Super or RTX 2070 Super with a R5 3600 or R7 3700X and it will still outperform your pcpartpicker list. And why do you need a sound card? Are you rocking a surround sound setup in your room to warrant a sound card? If not, save yourself some cash by not buying it. And what is with the external hard drive? If you're gonna build a system anyway, get an **internal** HDD instead.

I don't want you to think that I'm trashing on your pcpartpicker list, but with all due respect, you are paying way too much for less gain, and that a major no. Based on what you said on r/buildapc, you do not have to spend a lot based on the games you \[want to\] play. Hell, you can build or buy a $1200-$1500 build and still play those games absolutely fine. I will highly suggest going prebuilt (like aftershock) rather than going SLS to save the huge hassle on preparing and building a PC, and don't forget they (SLS) will (most likely) charge you extra for them to build you the PC.

But if you are serious on building your first PC, please understand the current trends on PC hardware and take the suggestions of other people on what PC hardware to buy at a given budget seriously as you will save money here and there. There are tons of content on YouTube that talk about what parts to get for your first PC, so if I were you, I will watch those and revise my pcpartpicker list.

Food delivery creates jobs for Singaporeans!

=== Author: wunderbare===
I agree that it's wasteful, but I also think some people are just that lazy lor. If they want to spend the money for some creature comforts, that's up to them. I personally will continue to buy my own food, especially when the delivery fee is more than half the price of my food.

I do think food delivery services are nice when you're at a gathering though. No need to send people out to buy stuff, just order in, continue having fun, and everyone will split the delivery fees.

=== Author: musr===
I'm just too poor/cheap to use food delivery myself. So far have only tompang on others food delivery.

Sometimes its okay to be cared for by your parents. To not be cared and thrown out the door as an individual at age 12 is a western thing, the asian parents still have their egos tied to the fact that they love you and raised you (of course there could be exceptions).

Chinese Singaporeans vs Chinese Malaysians cannot really be differentiated from my experience. Indonesia Chinese tend to be of a higher SES generally. You can easily tell if you're observant enough.

=== Author: Rained_===
Chinese Malaysians tend to post more Chinese on social media, use voice messages to communicate and listen to more mandopop compared to the average Chinese Singaporean.

=== Author: hmjustgottaknowshit===
Since you did mention **stereotypically**, I had a niece comment once that “Chinese Malaysian girls love wearing short shorts that expose their buttcheeks” while “Chinese Indonesian girls grow out their facial hair, specifically the hair on their upper lip” I did not know to what extent how true this was prior to her comment but I did start noticing this in some, not all, of them.

It's not a law, the 250 pax rule is just strongly encouraged to be followed.

=== Author: immarandompotato===
Hey. I've been in your shoes and i know it feels terrible right now. I only started hardcore studying from May because i was too focused on my CCA. The first time i passed all my subjects in the same sitting since j1 was during prelims. Thankfully i got decent grades for As (not straight As or anything) to get into a local uni. And there are so many other U to A cases, so hang in there!! You still got about 7 more months to A levels, and that's the exam that matters. 

Right now maybe either just focus on 1 subject and catch up on the other 2 later on, or try to cover almost 50% of each subject before monday? Depends on your learning style. You can PM me if you want, hang in there! :)

=== Author: deepfriedceleron===

There's many telemedicine providers like whitecoat, Doctor Anywhere or DoctorWorld that you can talk with over the phone

=== Author: tenbre===
While telemedicine is good, being physically at the gp clinic allows the doctor to take your pulse, bp, temperature, listen to your lungs for pneumonia signs, assess how you are breathing, and also check your sore throat condition.
If you are feeling unwell, do go to the gp or Polyclinic.

why dont you go read up about the dorscon levels and what it takes to be implemented before you ask such questions then? information is everywhere out there on the internet.

=== Author: hellopandant===
Honestly, some people here damn cb or up on their high horse. I used to wonder why some seemingly harmless questions asked here will have downvotes... now I don't care. Also people here damn bandwagon, see a downvoted comment and will downvote it without thinking about it much.

Not caring about downvotes is a good attitude to have. Looks like some commenters want people to read research papers and do a thesis before commenting (ok exaggerating but you get the point)

edit: But at the same time, practice social responsibility and try to do your due diligence. I get why some questions might be downvoted because they are deemed as fear mongering. It's a delicate balance.

No recommendations, but as someone who is currently learning the language too, here are some things that I think you can look up while you're looking for a structured program:

* Basic grammar: how certain words like ""the"" and ""is"" don't have an equivalent in Malay, how word order in Malay is slightly different (how ""my neighbour's head"" will be parsed as ""head neighbour my"" in Malay), special rules for words like ""yang""

* Vocab of course: I recommend using a flashcard app like Anki and constantly adding in new words as you study. Make sure you review both Malay -> English (for vocab and translation) and English -> Malay (to pull the words out from thin air)

* Affixes and how they affect spelling: we learned di-, peN-, meN- and ber- in my current level (most basic level)

This is my first time asking about Doscorn. I saw the post so I left a comment there. 

Yes, I could have googled it or something. But since I was there why not ask? Isn’t that the point of reddit? To discuss. Almost anything can be googled, so should everyone not ask anything?

I first commented “RIP” but then I added the question because why not? It’s a harmless question and it’s relevant. But I guess not...

Id like to add that affixes can change the word class or tense, so you have to be sure what affix goes with what word to convey the right meaning. Eg peN- affix is meant to be used with a verb to make a people pronoun(idk how else to say this) like pe- + nyanyi (sing) = penyanyi (singer). Theres more affixes that what the above comment stated but I guess theyre more higher level (although i learnt them in primary sch;;)

=== Author: RevolvingWeasel===
Even a slum is better than Punggol

=== Author: bilbolaggings===
Well good on them for getting that one.

I've lived in quite a few places (even a ""ghetto"" area rental flat) and Punggol/Sengkang were the worst. 

It's ulu without the benefit of ulu, there's a lot of people. Will only get worse as more people move in.

Hard to get to anywhere, the only way out is the purple line. Absolute clusterfuck during peak hours. 

Only one mall.

Lots of YPs.

I felt that it's hotter at night there than in other places due to the building density.

=== Author: deepfriedceleron===
I got a cousin that I visit once a week-ish...and omg I would hate to live at Punggol. The only mall is at the MRT and it's always crowded so good luck with that esp if you live damn far from the MRT. No mamashop or 7 eleven nearby either. Road layout damn boring personally, I hate grids. Take private tpt? Good luck with everyone going in and out of the only two? three? entrances and exits to TPE, two of them shared with Sengkang. Take MRT? Punggol is the end station, only way in and out of Punggol is by that or bus. Only real upside is the nature ah, which is also slowly receding as they build more HDBs. Then again the roads also so big and wide, not pedestrian friendly, so few trees...

&#x200B;

I really hate punggol, no offence to ppl living there :p

As you go to a few doctors, do they all know the previous diagnosis?

If I'm not wrong, you should always follow the latest doctor's advice, unless that doctor tell you to continue a previous doctor's medicine too.

Take note of the condition and if get really worst see doctor again. You can type the condition into a daily journal and take photograph so it's easier to objectively compare improvement or get worse.

>> Is it mandatory for retail establishments to exercise safe distancing?

>>Retail establishments are required to comply with safe distancing measures. These precautionary measures can help reduce the risk of local spread of COVID-19. Businesses which do not implement or comply with the government’s safe distancing advisories may be ineligible for government grants and loan assistance.

(Source: https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19/safe-distance)

So it feels like more like a ""strong"" advisory? Not very sure whether wedding banquet locations will follow through.

I think everyone is just on their toes and if they see DORSCON Red it triggers people.

=== Author: aocduster===
aka ""I could have spent 5 seconds googling dorscon but I want you guys to spoonfeed me instead."" There are discussions on here that you can't google, having someone ask ""is it dorscon red yet"" every time covid news pops up isn't one of them. That's because there's no discussion that would result from it, the answer is just ""no"" and the thread dies there.

=== Author: noodlesaucetime===
in the first place, shouldn't you gather info from a credible source before taking part in a discussion with other people? rather than listening to what others say (which could be opinions over facts) that could also lead to false info being spread. 

personally i just think that's the more logical thing to do. wherever you go you cant always expect answers to be handed to you. but if you insist on asking and feeling butthurt over people not giving you the answer, then you do you.

Sure, of course gathering information from credible sources makes sense. But as I said earlier, it also makes perfect sense to ask questions or start a discussion on reddit.

For example, news breaks out that LeBron James broke his leg (touch wood) and is out for the whole of the season. I’m on the NBA subreddit, and ask how many games are left in the season. Sure, I can google that. But i’m already on the subreddit. The subreddit for NBA, on the post about the relevant incident. What’s wrong with that?

And I’m not stupid. Even if someone told me Dorscon Red is being implemented effective immediately, i’m not gonna start spreading the news on whatsapp or something. And even then none of us really knows. It’s up to the government, my question is really more of gathering opinions than looking for a straight answer. 


I’m not feeling butthurt over anything. Some people were nicer, and gave me answers. But most either downvoted or said something like “this has been asked many times”. I would appreciate it if people just ignored me. It’s the attitude of many here that I don’t get. If someone cant ask a question (regardless of how commonly asked) without getting heavily downvoted, then why have this subreddit? :)

I landed today from the US and was not tested. There was a separate customs line for people with travel history from ""affected countries"" (China, S Korea, Japan, Europe, etc) but I think (check MOH to be sure though) they were only issued SHNs. I don't think Australia was on the list.

=== Author: Theycalisse===
I have a flight with my girlfriend from Krabi in Thaïland to Changi International Airport this Friday. 

Afterward, we have a flight to Japan, and then Canada, but we need to check-in again in order to take this flight and the connection.

We saw on the airport website that travellers that visited some specific countries have to be quarantined for 14 days or if it's a short travel, tell the place where they will be for the next couples of days.

We are scared because if we check out to check in afterward, we might be placed in quarantine just to not take any chances, even if we don't leave the airport.

Can someone tell me if he think we'll be okay? (no symptoms so far, masks and everything) Of if we should completely dodge Singapore and book another flight from Bangkok maybe?

=== Author: Ethanol95===

I don't think they have enough test kits to test every single person coming from the US, Europe etc

=== Author: chowder138===
I'm guessing it's because of population density and the importance of US travel to SG. I think they don't want to ban US unless it's absolutely necessary.

US has also only exported a couple cases to SG, which might also be a factor.

=== Author: Theycalisse===
I don't. But we checked the ministry of health of Singapore and it doesn't apply if we don't leave the transit area. But we need to leave in order to check-in to our connecting flight.

=== Author: Throwaway90090011===
I thought only travellers who are ASEAN nationals need a declaration of health. Assuming OP is a non-ASEAN national visiting ASEAN, he doesnt need one upon arrival in Singapore.

There are a lot of people who do not have healthcare insurance in US can't access or afford health services

=== Author: Throwaway90090011===
I'd check with the airline you're travelling on from Krabi to Singapore if they have an interline agreement with the airline you're travelling on from Singapore to Japan. If they do, they could just check your baggage through & you wouldnt have to leave transit.

=== Author: pendelhaven===
Technically you are right, but since the virus doesn't differentiate, it would be silly to assume otherwise. Just afraid OP would be barred from boarding at the airport.

I have check with the airline and they close their customer service two days ago.

We were able to book another flight from Bangkok to Japan and to Canada. Safer since we're already in Thaïland.

Sigh, see, with every claim of his, this Ailment justifies the use of POFMA to all heck.

=== Author: Satireisus===
All it required was clarification a day after the Chinese press revealed that it was group associated with PA and RCs. Instead they spent more than week claiming it was private dinner rather than saying that PA/ RC did not organise it even though they are associated with PA/RC. 

Why the need for POFMA when a simple early clarification would suffice. 

So again we see the need to kill the chicken to frighten the monkeys so eventually everyone keeps quiet. Not the way to build a society.

> # Correction directions issued over claims PA, RCs involved in organising SAFRA Jurong dinner linked with COVID-19 cluster

> SINGAPORE: Facebook posts claiming that the People's Association (PA) and/or the Residents' Committees (RCs) were involved in organising a dinner event at SAFRA Jurong that a COVID-19 cluster is linked to are false, the POFMA Office said on Wednesday (Mar 18).

> As of Tuesday, the COVID-19 cluster linked to the dinner event on Feb 15 at Joy Garden Restaurant in SAFRA Jurong is Singapore's largest, with 47 confirmed cases.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These statements were posted on Facebook and shared by users 'Henryace Ace', Mr Sebastian Ying, and Mr Lim Tean on both his Facebook pages, the POFMA Office said.

> Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, who is the minister in charge of PA, has instructed the POFMA Office to issue correction directions to all three Facebook users.

> 

> An article on the Government's Factually website said that PA and the RCs were not involved in organising the dinner function on Feb 15, and were ""not in a position to cancel it"".

> 

> ""PA and the RCs also did not fund nor publicise the dinner event,"" the article added.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""The event was a private dinner function organised by a singing instructor for members of her singing groups.""

> 

> It added that the Facebook posts made by several users claiming PA and the RCs' involvement in the function between Mar 8 and Mar 17 were ""entirely false"".

> 

> SOME PA VENUES SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES

> After the cluster was announced, PA said some of the patients linked to the function had subsequently attended classes and activities at seven community clubs and eight residents' committees. Activities at these venues were suspended for 14 days.

> PA also said it took ""immediate action"" and disinfected the affected rooms, along with other possible areas that the infected individuals might have visited.

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Mar 10 that many locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in Singapore ""were the result of the socially irresponsible actions of a few individuals"" who continued to attend events and activities despite being unwell.

> To curb the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore, members of the public should avoid social contact and see a doctor early if unwell, the health minister added.

> ""This socially irresponsible behaviour poses a risk to all of us. The measures we have implemented will only work if individuals cooperate and behave in a socially responsible manner,"" said Mr Gan.

> Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others, said the Ministry of Health.

Because it's a private event. If you didn't organise something, why would you issue a preemptive statement saying that you didn't organise it? One would need to be a precog to do such thing.

---

I'm just curious to know what level of association PA had with the private event that they didn't organise. For example, was their logo shown on stage and posters? Was this event advertised on A4 posters at CCs and RCs?

I said this before, our public organisations lack finesse in communication.

Speaking of Chinese press, they reported there are videos of dinners organised by this singing teacher where her students gave her red packets and hang flower garlands on her. No wonder she didn’t want to cancel.

When someone makes a false claim you must correct it asap and not let it fester. If someone says that you married illegally a second wife in Thailand and it spreads around in your workplace and town. Are you going keep quiet just because it did not happen? It’s basic common sense.

Agree and thanks for the insight. My theory is that the govt minders took time to go up the chain explaining what should be done until they reached CCS.

> # SDP: M’sia lockdown could result in ‘tens of thousands of workers’ infected with Covid-19 to enter S’pore

> Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chief Chee Soon Juan has reiterated his call for a general election not to be called in Singapore so soon in the wake of Malaysia’s recent announcement of a lockdown.

> Chee said on March 17 that holding an election “in light of the latest announcement in Malaysia and our own deteriorating circumstances” would be “unconscionable”.

> Chee had previously urged the government to only hold an election when there are “clear signs that the situation has abated”, referring to the Covid-19 outbreak around the world.

> Chee made his comments on a Facebook post on March 17, saying that there is now more reason why the Singapore government should not call for a general election.

> SDP statement questioning health conditions of Malaysians

> A statement by SDP also said that the Movement Control Order by Malaysia imposed from March 18 to 31 could result in “tens of thousands of workers” who “may be infected” making their way into Singapore before the lockdown took effect.

> The SDP statement read: “It may take a couple of weeks more before their health deteriorates by which time they may have spread the disease even wider among Singaporeans.”

> SDP also questioned if those under quarantine or Stay Home Notice would be “denied their right” to vote for their members of parliament (MPs).

> The elderly may also be deterred from coming out to vote, SDP said, as they may be more susceptible to the virus.

> The SDP statement also argued:

> But an election held in the midst of a chaotic pandemic will only cause confusion among the people. The collective anxiety will obscure grave and long-term issues such as foreigner influx, housing, job security and the cost of living that need to be nationally debated. A government elected under such circumstances based on political opportunism will cause much unhappiness among the electorate. This will further divide the nation.

> PM Lee said elections could be called early

> Prior to SDP’s statement and Chee’s comments, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post on March 14 that there is “no certainty” that the Covid-19 situation will be over before the end of term of the current government.

> The alternative is to call elections early and elect “a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it”, he said.

> “If we have to hold elections before Covid-19 is over, we will take all the precautions necessary, so that parties can campaign effectively, and people can vote safely.”

> Chee and at least seven other opposition political party chiefs had earlier called for election not to be called so soon.

> Chee said in a March 14 post that the election should only be held after the Covid-19 situation “has clearly turned around and Singaporeans are no longer under serious threat”.

I think he meant workers are all put into one small confined space which makes virus spread faster. Idk what he really meant.

=== Author: Kazozo===
The part about the workers don't make much sense. It's just a possibility. The lock down is probably the better way moving forward to control the disease.

However he is spot on about the elderly being forced to come out to vote. Anyone with old folks at home will understand the concerns.

Isn't the lock down going to make it better? The bigger unknown resvoir of virus is in Malaysia, the fact that they don't commute in and out daily now is actually detering that? Other then those already infected but not showing symptoms, isnt this better?

unless they're going on the tangent that if they're sick they will be stopped from crossing the border then...

honestly the implementation of SHN is sufficient to mitigate the spread from potential carriers… but perhaps we need to consider widening the scope to *ALL* incoming travellers

and if you think about it, a SHN is essentially a ban on tourists… if you have no business to stay here for more than 14 days then you definitely won't be coming… I have no qualms with ""medical tourists"" since they will be paying for their treatment and the SHN would ensure they don't spread the virus… plus it's good publicity for us on the whole anyway

The million-dollar question is: how do you stop the asymptomatic spreaders coming in from overseas and spreading the disease to the local community unknowingly? Because this is a pandemic with severe undertesting just about everywhere, you cannot assume that someone flying in from India, Kenya or Ecuador is clear of the virus.

At least give every visitor enough masks  to wear (and make him/her do so) for the duration of his/her visit so that he/she doesn't spread the disease unknowingly if you cannot enforce a quarantine on them.

With asymptomatic transmission more than possible, it is hard to completely stop the spread. Still, the measures placed to delay and slow down the spread is definitely working right now as it is completely within the capacity of the medical system in Singapore to treat and isolate the confirmed cases. 

The measures are there to flatten the curve of number of infections. 

Right now we are stable, but we still must be alert.

As I said, we are experiencing a curving trend, what our measures do is to flatten the curve.

Varantain,GovTech: 9 geeky myth-busting facts you need to know about TraceTogether,22,fmhm2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fmhm2l/govtech_9_geeky_mythbusting_facts_you_need_to/,44,1584836932.0,"Reposting in full because r/Singapore doesn't allow Facebook posts. 🙄

(Edit: [new non-FB source](https://www.tech.gov.sg/media/technews/geeky-myth-busting-facts-you-need-to-know-about-tracetogether).)

> TraceTogether (TraceTogether.gov.sg) is a mobile app that supports Singapore’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing. Through the exchange of short-distance Bluetooth signals between mobile phones with the installed app, each phone can detect other participating TraceTogether phones that are in close proximity.
> 
> Here’s a handy list of nine geeky facts you need to know about TraceTogether.
> 
> **Myth #1 - The government is using the TraceTogether app to track or spy on every citizen’s whereabouts.**
> 
> No, the TraceTogether app does not collect any location data and there is no way for the government to locate your whereabouts with this app. The app uses Bluetooth technology to exchange connections with nearby devices that have the app. The app only has the ability to show connections between devices, and not their locations. Furthermore, the logs stay in your phone. Should MOH need the logs for contact tracing, they will seek your consent to share the logs with them.
> 
> **Myth #2 - With the TraceTogether app running on my mobile phone that's Bluetooth enabled, anyone, including the government, can hack into my phone and extract all information in the phone.**
> 
> TraceTogether uses Bluetooth, a short-range peer-to-peer communications technology that is ubiquitous in mobile phones and devices today. It can only transmit signals within a range of about 10 meters. Using 
 TraceTogether is no different as connecting other devices or wearables to your phone via Bluetooth. It is impossible for anyone to get close enough to you, and use a computer to extract information from your phone without you noticing. TraceTogether uses several layers of security to keep your data private. Find out more at: https://go.gov.sg/tracetogether-privacy.
> 
> **Myth #3 - If I download TraceTogether and give consent to all in-app functions, I am essentially allowing the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the government to collect and gain access to all my personal data, as well as the data in my phone.**
> 
> When you set up TraceTogether, you will only be asked for your mobile number. This is the only personal data that MOH will hold about you, and it is stored in a highly secured server together with a random anonymised User ID that is linked to your mobile number. The security level of this server is as high as those servers that store other official information.
> 
> All MOH will get is your phone number. Commercial apps for emails, web browsing and movie-watching collect more data about you than this app.
> 
> When the app is running on your phone, it will create a temporary ID, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH. The temporary ID is then exchanged with nearby phones, and renewed regularly, making it impossible for anyone to identify or link the temporary IDs to you. The temporary ID can only be decrypted by MOH, with MOH's privately-held key. Your phone will store the temporary IDs from nearby phones, together with information about the nearby phone's model, Bluetooth signal strength, and time. All this information is stored locally on your phone, and not sent to MOH, unless you are contact traced.
>
> These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time.
> 
> **Myth #4 - If MOH contact-traced to me and asks me to upload the data stored in the TraceTogether app, the Ministry can also extract any other data that they want from my phone.**
> 
> When a TraceTogether user is a confirmed COVID-19 case and agrees to upload the data log in the TraceTogether app to MOH, MOH will decrypt the temporary IDs in the user’s app using its privately-held key, and obtain a list of phone numbers from the uploaded data log. Each phone number will only have the information related to the Bluetooth signal strength and time information. That is all the information that MOH will get from the user’s app log. Based on the signal strength and time information, MOH will then determine which devices were in physical proximity with the confirmed case.
> 
> **Myth #5 - I do not wish to download this TraceTogether app which will increase the risk of a data breach on my phone.**
> 
> The TraceTogether app does not increase the risk of a data breach on your phone. Given the TraceTogether app’s security and privacy safeguards, the risk of a data leak from your phone as a result of TraceTogether is very low. By downloading the app, you can tap on technology to enhance contact tracing -- a key pillar of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. The choice is yours to make.
> 
> **Myth #6 - All information in the TraceTogether app is uploaded onto a server that faces a perpetual threat of being hacked into.**
> 
> Apart from your mobile number, at the point of registration, all data collected through the TraceTogether app is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. It is not uploaded to any central server. The data will never be accessed, unless you have been confirmed as a COVID-19 patient. The MOH contact tracing team will then ask you for explicit approval to access the data in your app, and it is transferred to private storage that is not exposed to the Internet.
> 
> **Myth #7 - Other TraceTogether users can see my phone number.**
> 
> Mobile numbers are not revealed to other TraceTogether users. Only temporary IDs, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH, are exchanged between phones. Your mobile number remains secret and is not exchanged with other mobile phones. As an added layer of protection, the temporary IDs refresh regularly. Even if you could decrypt the temporary IDs, you would still not be able to obtain the mobile numbers of people you have been in contact with.
> 
> **Myth #8 - Even after I uninstall the TraceTogether app, my mobile number and the randomised User ID will remain in the server forever.**
> 
> Once the app is uninstalled or TraceTogether’s functionality disabled, all connection data collected on your phone will be lost. You can also request for your mobile number and User ID to be removed from the server by sending an email to support@tracetogether.gov.sg. This immediately renders all data collected by other TraceTogether phones about their interactions with you meaningless, because that data can no longer be associated with you.
> 
> Once contact tracing activities cease, the TraceTogether will prompt users to deactivate its functionality.
> 
> **Myth #9 - Running the TraceTogether app in the background uses up a lot of data and phone battery.**
>
> The app uses about 1MB of data in a day, which is equivalent to the data used by watching 1 second of a high definition movie, and consumes only marginally more battery than phones that already have Bluetooth enabled.
> 
> If this set of information does not satisfy your geeky curiosity, please visit https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg to read the full list of FAQs.
> 
> If you are convinced now that the app can do more good than harm, download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace&hl=en) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074) and help everyone at home to download too.

(OP edit: no idea why the iOS App Store link was to the US App Store, so I've changed it to the SG one.)

This is false. According to [this](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-develops-smartphone-app-for-efficient-contact-tracing) straits times article,

You are being forced to handover the data. No such thing as ""consent""

As a committed privacy advocate, security geek, and cryptographer, it seems to me that this app is doing the best job it can to protect your privacy, which is admirable under the circumstances. No, it is not perfect, and no app ever will be.  

But in the time of a global pandemic, our individual concerns about privacy are irrelevant. Now is not the time to be concerned about ourselves as individuals - that is selfishness. We need to temporarily put aside our individual concerns until this crisis is resolved.

Even from a selfish point of view (and we all are selfish at heart), this makes sense. Selfishly, I don't want to get infected. If I do get infected, it is likely to be will be from a stranger. Anything that can reduce the likelihood of community transmission to me benefits me. Contact tracing seems to be the single most effective way of reducing that spread, and I wish they would implement it in my home country. His makes contact tracing faster and more effective. Ergo it is better for me if I implement.

I've installed it. I'll delete it the instant this is over, but it's running now.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
The thing I've realized since my last post is that there are some people who will persist in posting misinformation or misrepresentations of what the app is, isn't and what your argument is and isn't. I would like to clear the air and make sure that the narrative here is one of constructive criticism rather than picking at useless minutiae of potential risk and 'principles' which are irrelevant to the topic at hand: To what extent should we be concerned about this app, and how beneficial can it be?

I AM NOT SPONSORED, OR A GOVERNMENT SHILL, as much as you'd love for that to be true. I am just excited that an app can potentially save thousands of lives, even millions, if we can prove it works and export this model abroad. I am convinced of its value and safety. 

They've claimed I am a shill/spy/whatever it is, they've claimed I don't know what I am talking about, they've claimed I am being defensive, etc, etc. I would like to take this moment to encourage everyone who is reading this and the post above to consider the following facts. 

This app was developed by a stat board. It is not made by the PAP, or indeed any political agency. They are staffed by people with very difficult-to-obtain degrees in IS, IT, and Comp-sci. If you fundamentally want to question their motives, that's fine. But the technology is sound and proven. 

**Safe anot?**

Encryption is a well understood topic. You use it daily for internet banking, logging in to reddit, surfing the web. Its nothing new to encrypt your information. It is very hard to steal information from your phone in ANY form, even so-called 'bluetooth snarfing'. The cost of attacking you is prohibitive in terms of time, exposure and potential reward gained. 99.999% of all people who will use this app have nothing valuable to steal from their phones. I agree there is a risk of such a thing happening, but in all likelihood? It will not happen. It is like being afraid of being struck by lightning. Can it happen? Yes. Will it happen? Extremely unlikely. 

**Why no open source?**

The government being the slow cumbersome beast it is are often staffed by people who know less than they should and yet are in higher levels of authority than other people who might have made better decisions. They may believe that not releasing the code is somehow more secure. There may also be proprietary/sensitive code involved in making this app. That is not to say that it is suspicious or is out to make money from you. It is just to indemnify themselves from potential risks. They have also stated that moving towards open source is something they want to do after this initial period. 

**Will it see if I go to geylang?**

No. It doesn't. Unless the Government pulls an MIB move with thousands of 'relay bluetooth stations' which is a fantastical idea at best, and absolute nonsense at worst. This was heavily upvoted in the other thread. I need to stress that while theoretically possible, if they actually do want to track everyone, there are less obvious and expensive ways to do so than that. This app specifically with regards to your movement does not enable the government to track you.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043224874-Can-TraceTogether-track-the-location-of-all-phones-installed-with-TraceTogether-

**I dont trust it, why should I install?**

This is more a philosophical debate than anything actually pertinent to the app, but allow me to default to a utilitarian argument: What number of infected cases would there need to be before you felt that this app was necessary? 100? 1000? 10000? What proportion of the population needs to be infected before you feel personally threatened enough to use the app for the sake, not only of yourself, but the old and those with pre-existing conditions around you? 5% of the population? 10%? 

I understand that before it becomes a problem you are wont to download this app and you'd rather have your privacy. Allow me to stress once again. It is safe, unless a state sponsored actor or billionaire playboy philanthropist comes in to try and track everyone. If you cannot understand the technology and have this fear, please read the FAQ below. I hope it can assure you of the good intentions and practices behind this app.

**Where can I read the declared intent and scope of the app and all relevant questions?**

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg

**Why are you so supportive of this app? You paid is it?**

I am actually very fearful personally of getting this virus, and I am fearful for loved ones getting the virus. Perhaps that is driving a deep sense of duty within me to control what I can. I have been sleeping much less for the last few days since the situation deteriorated  My insecurities are probably one of the things which are fuelling this enthusiasm for advocating for a solution. 

I have seen few other solutions to this virus which are as simple and effective as this one. Do not mistake my enthusiasm for malice. I truly believe that if this app works the way it should, then we have a solution to COVID19 spread which helps ensure life continues to go on, without any lock down, and that we can contain the spread.

=== Author: heil_to_trump===
In my personal opinion, I will only download the app if it's open source and that I must never be compelled to share the info it collects. Like another commenter pointed out, not giving consent to share the data it collects can be a criminal offence under the infectious disease act.

=== Author: orneryman===
Anyone know if it’s on record anywhere that the data, once released to MOH, will only be used for the sole purpose of contact tracing during this particular pandemic and will not be shared with any other agency without my authorisation?

=== Author: shavedawg===
I stepped out an hour ago for the first time since downloading the app.

I dont keep the app active at home so turned on bluetooth (iPhone) and stored the phone upside down in trouser pocket. Screen went dim.

Walked to MRT and travelled two stops to go to the supermarket.

Interestingly enough, I felt rather good knowing that this thing was in my pocket collecting signals from everyone who I walked past in close proximity. So not only does this app deliver objective results but it also contributed to making me feel a little less stressed about going out. YMMV but I felt a little better knowing I had it on me.

I mean, I get the privacy issue thing, but in such a national emergency I think privacy issues aren't my main concern at all. Not using the app (especially on an android phone) is plain selfish. You can always delete the app after this thing blows over, and having a loss of privacy for a couple months really isn't a big deal since it's temporary, even if you decide to go all conspiratorial and refuse to believe that they are saving data locally.

=== Author: BreakWindow===
I think it is a well-spent effort by the government agency coming up with an app that makes sense.

I am more concerned about whether is it even effective - you need a good proportion of people actively turning on the app (if you do not see the notification it is not scanning)

Yes, and even though it doesn't collect Where you are, that can be guessed from who you came into contact with. I know some people are saying the government can already track you so why not just download this, but then why give them even more info? 

Having something on your phone that the government can force you to give up is such a bad idea, you don't know how they will use it, can't sue them because they are exempt from PDPA.

You know, they can have the wrong reasons but right answer. Sometimes I think when shit hits the fan we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Its like when you are screamed at about safety during NS, and its this stupid thing everyone thinks is a waste of time, but it has fatal consequences. 

I want to frame the next week ahead as a decisive time for us to understand what our strategies are for the long term to combat the virus. If I have to step on a few toes to get this message across so be it. 

I want to dispel the notion that I think mass surveillance is acceptable, but I also don't want people to assume everything is fine. Everything is decidedly NOT fine. We should have this app and social acceptance ASAP, rather than be reactive. It is not even a form of mass surveillance. It is some people who take umbrage to the fact that there is no 'consent' in the diseases act. Wake the hell up people, the virus doesn't care for your principle. 

 I would rather be wrong personally, than right about the potential spread of COVID19 without efficient contact tracing and the TraceTogether app. I ask again for people to look past the few stuck-in-the-muds who are holding people back and to view it positively.

NS is compulsory, downloading the app is not

=== Author: orneryman===
But there’s nothing on record so far though? I downloaded the app earlier in the day but there’s no terms of service or anything (at least till the part they ask for your phone number) with which to hold anyone accountable for the use/misuse of the data once consent has been provided.  Apart from this, I’m quite satisfied with the privacy measures they have in place.

=== Author: shavedawg===
I haven't read a SgSecure review but  know the app. I remember seeing it and thinking: thanks, but I'll pass on this. While I wouldn't touch SgS with a bargepole I have no problems with TraceTogether.

I think folks need to prioritise the national interest and personal/public safety over any paranoid dystopian fantasies on privacy.

=== Author: shavedawg===
I am calm ... I know the app doesn't confer immunity but it does make you feel a little better that your chances at being contacted are a lot better if you did come into contact with someone who was found to be infected. Try it...you'll see what I mean.

Using the app does not free you from disinfecting hands regularly and not touching your face.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
If you ask me this virus is the biggest threat to national security in the last two decades, if not more. This virus is probably the single biggest crisis since LKY handed over leadership to GCT. We need an appropriate response. 

I am encouraging everyone to just do a simple thing, download the app and use it properly. You're prepared to pay with your life, with your blood and your time for this nation. Why is this app such a big deal?

They have a [privacy statement here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/common/privacystatement).

Seriously though, what would one do if they breach it? Sue them?

They only take a record of your phone number and upload it to a secured server (answered in myth 3)

Who said I was? Nationalism and patriotism are illogical concepts in and of themselves. 

> Why is this app such a big deal?

Because of privacy and consent. All the gov needs to do to gain my trust is to (1) make it open source so we know nothing fucky is going on, and (2) make the provision of personal data voluntary

=== Author: jigaopuaysi===
Government is exempt from PDPA.

=== Author: orneryman===
Yes, or judicial review I suppose.

=== Author: orneryman===
Yes, no issue with that. My only concern is the use of the data once it’s been released. Since there’s no terms of service, and government agencies are exempted from the PDPA, there’s no way to hold anyone accountable if there’s misuse of the data after consent has been provided and the data released to MOH.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Do you value your privacy over your life? Just a hypothetical. You're already being forced to serve national service. If the government forces you to have this app, or begins mass surveillance to slow the spread of the virus and ensures it never becomes Wuhan or Italy, will that be somehow more acceptable to you than downloading it and using it yourself?

Please don't take me the wrong way. I accept your need for privacy. I myself need and desire privacy. But we are looking at a crisis which threatens our country, something which can be avoided now with the co-operation of our people. What will it take for you to accept this app?

=== Author: Intentionallyabadger===
Pretty sure they will make you sign a consent form. 

If they did their homework right:-

1) Consent form would show which agencies the data will be shared to. 

2) The purpose of the data and how they will use it. 

3) How long your data will be kept 

Technically yes. You can sign, but there’s no way to tell for sure.

I’m the PDPA guy in my workplace. Usually it’s human error that causes the issues.

=== Author: heil_to_trump===
> Do you value your privacy over your life? 

But it's not a life and death scenario. I won't die if I don't download this app. It's not a binary choice.

> If the government forces you to have this app, or begins mass surveillance to slow the spread of the virus and ensures it never becomes Wuhan or Italy, will that be somehow more acceptable to you than downloading it and using it yourself?

No, I don't think that will be acceptable. Mass surveillance by governments has never worked well in history.

> What will it take for you to accept this app?

Did you read my comments above? 

1. Open source

2. Data collection is voluntary

=== Author: orneryman===
Yeah I mean GovTech has not stated this anywhere right? We’re just guessing? I was asking because wasn’t sure if they had mentioned it on some other channels that I’m not following.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
No you're right, but essentially the government is asking you to download this app and use it to facilitate contact tracing only when there is a need to do so. You will benefit not only yourself, but your community around you. 

If you are infected, you will be isolated more quickly with the app. If you are not infected, others who are will be isolated more quickly than without the app. The more people who use it, the exponentially better it will get until we reach saturation.

Mass surveillance has not been possible until very recently, the last 10 years, so there isn't very much historical data on it.

If Singapore has 10000 cases of infection, would you still cling on to those ideas? Not that those are irrelevant, or that they are unnecessary. I agree that fundamentally those two as a principle should be the case. What if this number was not 10000? What if it was 100k? Would you still hold on to those two ideas then?

=== Author: Intentionallyabadger===
Well they did say they’ll seek your consent. And that’s it haha. 

Everyone is just assuming at this stage that they will do their due diligence.

Lethaldart,"Why downloading TraceTogether not only makes sense, but is the right thing to do.",450,fm41s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fm41s6/why_downloading_tracetogether_not_only_makes/,325,1584771844.0,"Hi everyone, I've been thinking about lots of the assumptions behind this app and the technologies which enable it to work, as well as the effectiveness of the proposal. I've come to several key conclusions.



**Privacy**: The logic of this app is that it does not geo-locate or give away any identifiable information. While I did not develop the app, I do understand the principles behind it. It will drop 'handshake tokens' to other bluetooth enabled devices, within its range of 10 meters, which are encrypted. Now why should we be unafraid of this app?

* A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

* B. Duration of contact and proximity to other users. Note that it does not track where you visit. Even if you've been going to some less than desirable places, even if the police wanted to catch you out for visiting a red light district, they CANNOT find this information out from this app. You could have met the person who was infected on the bus, plane, train, car, whatever it is, it only reveals connections and not places. This proximity data is similarly encrypted, which all provides the same level of protection as previous mentioned above. If we take the government at their word, and the apple store with their policies and tight protection concerns about their users, we can very safely assume, short of some global conspiracy where Singapore's government is the FBI,CIA,FSB,NSA,Chinese Intelligence, GIGN, and all other intelligence agencies rolled into one, that we cannot have this information be leaked. 

* C. It cannot phone home to a central server. All information is kept on your device until the special PIN is provided to upload the encrypted data to MOH. It does not do anything beyond what is needed, that is, to use bluetooth and just handshake ONLY with other devices with the app. It cannot even collect data about devices which are bluetooth enabled around you. That is how specific and precise this app is. It collects ONLY what is needed and ONLY when necessary, that information that was collected will be uploaded. It is not going to steal your contact list or your nude photographs.

* D. Bluetooth is a short-ranged signal only ranging up to 10 meters at most. It is also low energy, which means it cannot cause cancer or whatever people are going to assume about radiation. It cannot make a call to a satellite and tell the FBI to come rappelling down via helicopter, nor can it intercept and leak all your private messages. Bluetooth is just another form of signal, one which is VERY short ranged. No one is going to 'hack' via bluetooth, because no one usually gets close enough to the target (5 meters) away and begin frantically typing away on your keyboard. If you do see such people please walk away from them and you will be safe.

EVEN if it is leaked, these are only phone numbers which are not particularly revealing. It will be used for the SOLE purpose of contacting you to inform you about risk, to interview about who you are in contact with, and how you can mitigate that risk, and if you need to be quarantined. It will keep your friends, family and colleagues safe. 

I should remind you that commerical apps, things like google home, and even your email and website usage are phoning home with your statistics all the time. If you can trust facebook, google, netflix, instagram, twitter, youtube, your email, you're already giving someone else your data. This app collects less data than all those other commonly used apps.

**Mathematics**: The principle of statistics make the utility of this app are undeniable, and the nature of the app and distributions about people, apps and disease make it even more compelling to download the app. We can make some key assumptions here about all these factors.

All assumptions here are napkin math, and written at 0400 in the morning, but I hope you can correct any erroneous assumptions.
Lets assume the users of the app are randomly distributed across Singapore. I realize this is not very realistic, but it is for the sake of argument. 

The app allows us to create a chain of contacts in the community by looking at how long you've been in contact with the person, and how close you've been to that person, and how frequently you've been in contact. All these facts will help establish how risky it is for you to have the virus if you're exposed to a known case.

Let us assume the people infected with the virus are also similarly distributed across Singapore.

Let us assume that both of these events are independent and cannot affect each other in any way.

Assume P(Have COVID19) is 385 / 5.7 million -- Number of cases / Population of Singapore

This is 0.00006754385. 

Now it becomes a question of if a person who has the app also has COVID19.

Multiply P(Have the App) and P(Have COVID19), which we've delightfully assumed to be independent events, so it is just 0.00006754385*P(Have the App).

How can we know the probability of you having the app? That's where this message comes in. This message is hopefully a factor which will convince to stop being lazy and to download the app, and use it properly. As of the time of writing, the app has 364 ratings on the Apple App Store. According to quora, some developers estimate about a 1% ratings penetration. We will assume the same. Thus on iOS we have maybe 35000 downloads. 

The iOS to Android Market Share is about 2:1, assuming that both iOS and Android users have the same general habits, we can assume about 70000 downloads for the android platform.

This puts us at 100000 downloads. If we only have half of these users use the app properly, we will have 50,000+/5.7 Million people with the app. This is about 0.9%, which I will round to 1% for the sake of convenience.

So this equation right now is
0.00006754385*P(Have the App) = 0.00006754385*0.01 = 6.75438596e-7 Such a small number!

How effective can this be? 
Well think about our daily interactions. The risk of exposure to COVID-19 scales with duration and proximity, so not all encounters are made equal, but think about how many people you come into contact with daily. 

Your grab driver, your coffeeshop aunties, your colleagues, bosses, teachers, classmates, friends and family. If we assume a conservative 5 people a day that you meet, that means that daily in singapore, 5.7 million people have 5 interactions each, all with the possibility of getting the virus. This works out to about 30 million interactions. 

Each one of those interactions multiplied with that number above will give us the number of EXPECTED exposures daily, with the app. This is 20.263155. That means we have a potential of about 20 people to be contacted via the app to break the chain of transmission, and this is only at 1% of all singaporeans using the app! Please, please, please download this app. It gets exponentially better the more people use it. 

TL;DR

This app is genius and can actually solve COVID19 Spread. Please download. It will only take a small amount of time, it is safe, secure, reliable, and can save your life and mine. It is not SGSecure, it is a well thought out principle made by some incredibly smart people @ govtech. It will help stop this virus. It will not invade your privacy or make you go to jail. It is one of the most simple and elegant solutions i've seen in an app, and it is relevant now. It will save the life of your ah gong, your ah man, your caifan seller, your boss (even if you dont like him or her very much) your wife, your children, and your own.

Hey OP

As someone who has no knowledge about such tech, just wanna say thanks for taking the time to explain the app and encourage adoption.

One qn I have is, once COVID19 blows over and I delete the app/remove permissions - will it be comepletely removed from my mobile and close the doors on any potential dataflow from that point onwards?

=== Author: saperis===
Given the number of data leaks in recent months from health records to blood donator data, it is not far fetched for people to be worried about such apps and data collection. 

Furthermore, the app uses workarounds to circumvent Apple restrictions and limitations on tracking data. 

Also, how accurate is this setup? There was no mention of it. 

There is no 3rd party testing or certification, Nor is the developer willing to share in detail what is being collected and how they intend to use it. There is also no mention of the data collected will be purged after x months and whether it will be shared across with other agencies. 

It is one thing to trust the Govt, and another leap of faith to install a permanent app in the phone collecting data all the time.

=== Author: roksah===

=== Author: Oradious===
After reading the whole thread and OP's replies, I've found that OP has some skewed conceptions about the security aspects and concerns about this whole thing.

Firstly,

>A. Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.

Lmao. For someone who sounds so technologically informed, I was surprised when I realised what OP wrote when I read this for the second time. Sounds like OP is confusing the difference between hash and encryption, which should be a basic concept in the field of IT/Cybersecurity.

Furthermore, phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits, and either starts with 8xxx xxxx or 9xxx xxxx. Brute forcing the combination with a self-made list containing all the possible phone numbers isn't really that hard to do, and won't take up a lot of time, considering the computing and processing power that computers have these days.

OP also replied to one of the comments by saying "" There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth"". Well, let me introduce you to [Bluejacking](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5045/bluejacking), [Bluebugging](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5044/bluebugging) & [Bluesnarfing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5046/bluesnarfing).

Building on what I've said earlier about Bluetooth, if some siaokia really wants to, he can build a malicious version of the app, and use it to extract the supposedly anonymous information, or modify the payload and send malware into other devices using Bluetooth.

OP subsequently said the following in another of his replies:

>And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat.

You'd be surprised. The value of the information may outweigh the risk of contracting of the virus to some, and some hackers would still take the risk of getting into a crowded idea just to hijack other devices. If they are that scared of the virus, they can easily minimise the risk by driving around in a car, carrying out a [wardriving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving) bluetooth attack.

OP is also operating under the presumption that hackers won't want to go out and gather all that information/deliver malware during this period. That's like saying ""Oh I shouldn't leave my housedoor locked, it's too much of a hassle. It's COVID period now. who would want to break into my house, right?""

OP keeps insisting that he isn't some government employee, and that he isn't paid to do this. But with how much of a tryhard he is in this thread, I honestly doubt so.

I'm not here to discourage people from downloading the app, but I'm here to inform people of the potential risks that they're getting into by downloading this app/prolonging their use of bluetooth, and to point out OP's flaw in logic/misconception as well.

At the end of the day, the code is not open-sourced, so we can only speculate for sure.

=== Author: modeler===
Boy, do I have something you need to know: there's already a mesh of bluetooth trackers all over Singapore already, sending data to stores, adtech companies and more: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/14/opinion/bluetooth-wireless-tracking-privacy.html

All you need to track a specific individual is their bluetooth MAC and their phone number/name/NRIC.

I think this might well be overall a good thing for Singapore, but you are completely wrong about the personal privacy issues this throws up.

=== Author: alexqproof===
No open source no talk. If they are really trying to help, just make it open source la stop being so typical and try to make a proprietary tracking/reporting app under their ""HIVE"" initiative. It's not something special and people already stigmatize against apps like SGSecure so why go on and repeat the same mess?

=== Author: Spaiduhz===
An always on Bluetooth radio on my phone polling every few ticks, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that.

You may be under the impression that since leaving GPS and Bluetooth on doesn't drain your battery much compared to when it's off. I'll remind you that the radios actually consume power when they are in use. Bluetooth that frequently polls will consume battery. How much will depend on what radio your phone has.

If you need your phone to last you your entire day and you typically end with under 20%? Bring a Powerbank.

=== Author: avocado_milkshake===
I would honestly love to have a peek at the source code, and I've emailed the team to ask about open-sourcing this.

I have a question about how a handshake token is generated using MOH's private key without the app requiring Internet connectivity to work. Perhaps they meant public key stored locally...?

=== Author: musr===
> It will not invade your privacy or make you go to jail.

You can be charged under the Infectious Disease Act for refusing to upload the data when requested. Source: Straits Times article today.

When I read this I was like, you voluntarily install an app, and make yourself liable to being a criminal?!

But I installed the app la, coz if requested I'll submit the data. I've already enabled Google Maps' timeline since 13 January expressly to facilitate contact tracing should it be required. I for one am very privacy and security conscious. Wouldn't say the top 1%, but most likely top 15%. But I think that containment is more important.

=== Author: aelesia-===
As a software engineer, ""trust me"" isn't good enough. The only way I would trust it is if the code is open source.

=== Author: tehtf===
For this Bluetooth token you speak off, is it possible to provide info how long the handshake/ devices are within range? One other criteria besides distance is also period of exposure to case

=== Author: BGen_Tan===
Actually I send this Reddit to a smart friend of mine who doesn't have Reddit at the moment and I forgot an important thing about hashing. Hashing is also bound by the size of input. Siao liao, graduate from SoC forgot some thing liao

You see:

""Your Phone Number, encrypted so it looks like a hash like this. ""9I8VPeQeWDofj39c8dPySoUXLqh2"" It is not possible, or at least, computationally extraordinarily difficult to break this hash without a password that only MOH has. It will take millions of dollars in equipment and computing power to even stand a small chance of revealing your phone number. No one cares enough about you to do all that.""

My friend unfortunately LOL'd hard

Firstly, if the hash can be broken with a password, and the hash property of being one way algorithm and has no key needed does not hold water. This looks more like encryption. Some people mix up hashing and encrypting often.

Secondly, given the size and space of Singapore's phone number, digits size of 8, each from 0 to 9, it is rather quick to brute force to calculate all hashes, even if the hashing is implemented correctly indeed.

While I agree with everything you mentioned and how this app is a genius idea, I have some questions with regards to point A.   


Since all our phone numbers are 8 digits long and start with either a 8 or 9, wouldn't it be trivial to reverse engineer the hashing algorithm if I manage to collect large enough sample of phone number and their encrypted equivalent?

I like Trace Together as a concept very much and I think the team have done an excellent job.

Contact tracing is best done without excessive interaction, and less reliance on faulty human memory. Bluetooth Low Energy was built for this.

I'm also heartened by the approach of storing the data as a local blob which never leaves your phone unless the user AND MOH both validate.

This is important to prevent false positives (DOS/spam attack vector) from pranksters by requiring MOH validation, and address concerns of Orwellian state sponsored surveillance by requiring user opt-in. If people have unaddressed security concerns, they won't install and we fail to get the critical mass needed for this to work.

𝑀𝑦 𝑠𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑟𝑒:
𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐬, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐬

In the Straits Times article
""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.""

This stance just discourages people from installing, they can't be charged for not allowing release of information they don't have. 

Using this stick approach narrows the user acquisition funnel, for marginal enforcement gain at best. 
If a user has already installed the app, at the cost of battery life, system resources and privacy, they've already committed at some level, threatening prosecution to secure permission they've already implied at point of install, comes at the cost of turning many potential users off with draconian enforcement. 

That said, it's not stated on the CNA article, so that may not be the official policy stance. If that's the case, the Straits Times article should be corrected so it doesn't discourage installs due to fear of recrimination. 

In my opinion, it's better to set incentives by giving privileged access to critical and scarce services to people who use the app.
Eg: higher queue preference for testing and ICU given to people based on length of days running the app.

I understand these are in the plans (based on the lead's Facebook comments) , which would be great because the more eyes we have on the code, with adequate responsible disclosure, the global infosec community can help this improve, and reduce unforeseen bugs or exploits which leak or compromise user data and result in loss of confidence in the system.

Also, it allows other countries with less sophisticated contact tracing infrastructure & manpower to leverage on this work to secure their populations. Safer neighbours means less imported cases and helping them helps us eventually.

I've heard anecdotal feedback from friends that the resource and battery consumption are on the high side for a passively running app. Bad ux will cause uninstalls. My 4g and wifi performance suffered at night until i force quit it.

I'm sure this will improve over time. I urge people to trust this will be fixed eventually, but it would be useful for users to have a feedback channel to assure them that their concerns will be addressed. I understand this consumes support resources, but the cost of churn from frustrated users would cost the effort more.

While I would like to trust this app, the skeptic in me thinks that we should be cautious. 

1. The app can be designed to simply create handshakes between two phones. And not put a pin on geolocating. But this does mean that it is basically able to connect you with every and all of your acquaintances. 
2. That said, MOH having the key doesn't make me feel any safer. MOH has had numerous breaches over the last few years putting their security measures and vigilance into question.
3. Further, in a nanny-like state in Singapore, it is not unfathomable that some guy in the investigative services decide that hey let's try to use this to check if some suspect us associated with XYZ. 
4. As much as I hate using this word, big data is actually a thing. While the app may not call home, knowing the location of just a few users it will be able to create what is effectively the geolocation of your phone. 

This app may have been designed with the good intentions and great minds of fellow Singaporeans. However, the potential (mis)uses that could arise will pose significant privacy concerns.

I take umbrage that their solution says it helps contact tracing but *it also anonymises your data*. Hello? How do you contact trace an anonymous person?

Sure, they have taken steps to protect your privacy and data, but there must be some reversible algorithm going on here to allow the authorities to trace back and identify who is TanAhGao69 right? The secret sauce is then what is the algorithm? It surely isn't some polymorphic cipher; because otherwise it's not reversible. What's stopping an adversary from decompiling the Android APK and identifying how the data is encoded and creating their own rogue TraceTogether?

What's more, there are glaring security concerns for leaving an essentially open beacon up on everyone's phone that's willing and accepting any information requests from any similar beacon - which is as good as leaving your level 1 window sill open. Well equipped adversaries can exploit this on unpatched devices to force feed data onto your phone.

Granted, these are assumptions made in the absence of the technical information pertaining to this app. I appreciate the intent and the greater good this app is serving, but in the absence of information, I will err on the side of caution. Just stick to your regular social distancing.

Seeing that open-source has been raised a few times along some of the comments, I shall put up my anonymized summary from an insider pal of mine (for his compliance and job sake of course, and he is my faculty junior):

1. There has been plans for citizens to contribute, no promises though. (Me: I saw another user pointed this out somewhere down here.)
2. Note that GovTech has Compliance to follow too, they as personal capacity and opinions had to take down their statement from time to time
3. Traditionally the govt prefers Security over Obscurity. (Starting from here is my opinion for this point 3): So cultural change may be needed to help promoting open-source it seems. Just as per another insider friend of mine mentioned. BTW OP's comment checks out on this one.)
4. For this one, for my faculty junior's sake, I will just put it this way: Some details need to be ironed out before open-source is possible. Just think along the whole process of developing and publish the app and you'll see what is involved and needs to be discussed.

If someone has COVID, they and those who were in contact with them will be quarantined. It's either that or they/contact won't be aware that they have it.

This app would work if the infected person went out of their quarantined premises and have the app installed. I'm sure such a person would get into trouble for leaving their quarantined premises in the first place. I could be wrong but what I understand about quarantine is that there will be checks to ensure that the person has remained within their premises.

Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine?

It's either that, or I'm not understanding something - which isn't addressed in the OP.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not against the app. This is a good initiative that can help others and there should be more. I just don't see the effectiveness in this app when the conditions defeat the purpose of it.

While the App is brilliant in theory, the execution is missing a mark for I-phones. If you have an I-phone, it requires the app to be permanently open (and not running in the background), which is not sustainable, as if you have a phone, you actually want to use it (otherwise why have a phone?).

I would expect iPhone users to not be very helpful as the app needs to be in the foreground to work, I suppose due to iOS security limitations.  My wife would definitely forget to swap back after using WhatsApp or Facebook for example.

Regarding open-source being asked in several comments:

1. There has been plans for citizens to contribute, no promises though. (I saw another user pointed this out somewhere down here.)
2. Note that the agency has Compliance to follow too, they as personal capacity and opinions had to take down their statement from time to time
3. Traditionally the govt prefers Security through Obscurity. (Starting from here is my opinion for this point 3): So cultural change may be needed to help promoting open-source it seems. Just as per another agency friend mentioned. BTW OP's comment checks out on this one.
4. For this one, for my pal's sake, I will just put it this way: Some details need to be ironed out before open-source is possible. Just think along the whole process of developing and publish the app and you'll see what is involved and needs to be discussed.

Source: My convo with my friends in the agency, some may or may not necessarily a part of the development team.

I am one of the most paranoid people I know with regards to privacy....highy distrustful of any sort of tracking. But it took me all of 2 seconds to choose to download this app. These are extraordinary times and I would want to know if I have come into contact with someone who has been found infected. I would also like to know if any family members with whom I share close spaces have come into contact with an infected person. Any kind of early warning system is a boon right now. 

I don't use my phone do do anything sensitive like internet banking or online shopping so there are no passwords, PIN not etc stored on it. I hope everyone gets this app because that is when its benefits are really optimised.

=== Author: eviltofu===
Why would they hash the phone number? I would just generate a random 512 or 1024 bit id (or just a UUID) and issue it to the phone during the on boarding process. Then when another app requests the data I would send the hash with a digital signature.

Another qn is the app requires location permissions for android (bcos this is mandated for Bluetooth use). While the FAQ states the app will not collect location info, fair to say this is ultimately up to how much you trust the developers? It will be pretty easy for them to tweak the codes to collect location data if they want to. And we'd have already gave permission ahead of time.

Thanks!

Also you can remove the app but whatever data you have the government can still force you to hand it over

=== Author: hosehliao===
I think once you delete most apps they cannot track you anymore, but the data may still be in your phone and whatever data already collected, they would already have.

I don't know why such an app would be released without addressing all the privacy and ethical concerns though, it's like the government is using this crisis to try and get more people to accept loss of privacy :/

=== Author: Art_em_all===
I think it’s pretty clear. The app is not really well thought through. Since it was designed and developed under pressure. However it is for a good cause. 
And honestly, if i have to sacrifice a bit of my “precious” privacy - in order to help out with covid situation - it’s a no brainer. I’m in. 

I believe it is one of those rare times when situation around us gives us opportunity to be more than just ourselves. And, reasonably speaking - this app won’t get more data from you  than google / facebook/other literary every social media - it’s just the benefit here not likes and views but rather possible lives.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Hi, allow me to allay your fears with the FAQ from the developers.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/categories/360003158594-Permissions-and-Privacy

If you do not trust this process I can understand, but I am telling you from a fundamental development point of view, you are risking only 1 thing. Bluetooth, and your phone number. If you google bluetooth, you will realize it is also a short ranged signal which cannot allow the government to track you, unlike wifi. If you believe the government is using this for a nefarious ends, then you should also be wary of 3g, 4g and wifi as well. It does not make sense to be afraid of this app and yet continue to use networks!

=== Author: retaki===
I agree with you about concerns of data leaks but that should not deter us from considering  adoption of new technology. 

&#x200B;

> Also, how accurate is this setup? There was no mention of it. 

I agree that this is lack of evidence on the official site. 

But from googling, I found research articles such as [Never Lose! Smart Phone based Personal Tracking via Bluetooth](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73da/ddb1e43f985d318aef5ec89e88a3f9fe5374.pdf) . So it is probably not a baseless app. I am not a research student, thus not in a position to do a proper search for specific research papers.

&#x200B;

>Nor is the developer willing to share in detail what is being collected and how they intend to use it 

Here is the info on [data collection](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/sections/360007409134-Privacy-and-Data) .

""The only data that we collect is your mobile number, so that MOH can contact you more quickly if you were in close proximity to a COVID-19 case.

With your consent, TraceTogether exchanges Bluetooth proximity data with nearby phones running the same app. However, this data is anonymised and encrypted, and does not reveal your identity or the other person's identity. Also, this data is stored only on the user’s phone. Should MOH need the data for contact tracing, they will seek your consent to share it with them."" -  

&#x200B;

> It is one thing to trust the Govt, and another leap of faith to install a permanent app in the phone collecting data all the time. 

Here are details on [deletion of the app](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360044789414-What-happens-if-I-delete-the-app-or-switch-phones-) and [removal of data from the app's server](https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735713-How-can-I-stop-sharing-my-data-).

"" When the app is deleted, all locally-stored data in the app will be deleted. A user will no longer be able to share the stored logs should they be contacted by a contact tracer. They need to re-install and set up the app again to participate in TraceTogether. If you've changed your phone and retained your original mobile number, no worries. You can download TraceTogether on your new phone and register with your mobile number. The TraceTogether data in your previous phone will not be ported over to your new phone. It will stay in your previous phone for 21 days, after which it'll be deleted. ""

"" You can revoke consent by emailing [support@tracetogether.gov.sg](mailto:support@tracetogether.gov.sg) with the mobile number you registered in the app.

We will then delete your mobile number and permanent ID from our server. This means that all data that your phone has exchanged with other phones will no longer be associated with you.""

In conclusion, as we have trusted our govt and their measures so far, so why not continue putting your trust in the govt that this app is done in our interest and with proper measures to protect our privacy.  And as many have pointed out, this app will only be meaningful and effective when a sizable number of people use it.

For Android, go into your main settings>under apps>trace together(this screen is where you can see storage/cache/permissions/notifications etc). Under notifications, there should be a minimise option available, which will collapse it under 'other notifications' in the notification bar. It doesn't remove it completely, but groups it together with other unimportant notifications and removes the mini icon at the top. 

Not sure if this will work on all Android devices, as I'm using a OnePlus 7 pro. Does the trick for me! Hope this helps you out

Android? IIRC its a workaround to prevent the OS from killing the process. I'd assume they are doing something in the background that isn't just polling for info

Hi, what notification are you referring to? When I downloaded the app, I put in my phone number, got the OTP, registered, and read the instructions. I allowed it to turn on bluetooth and its permissions, left my bluetooth on and because I am on iOS, i do not shut the app or my screen off. I leave it on. 

If you have already downloaded it, please read and follow the instructions carefully so we can all enjoy the benefit of being protected by it!

I think if we operate on the principle of harm prevention, we need to be trusting that this solution is intended to do exactly what it claims to be: To enable contact tracing in the case of a virus. It is not going to somehow be this NSA spyware level of surveillance. It is a response to the spread of COVID19.

It is not open sourced, but there are numerous good reasons for it not to be. I have some background knowledge of how development works and trust me when I say that if it goes on the iOS store, it is quite reliable. The alternative is to reduce the protection from the networking effect and expose yourself to risk. You have to hedge both.

=== Author: snarky-monkey===
I wonder how many calling for the code to be open sourced are proficient enough to perform security assessments and audits on the code base.

At the end of the day, 95% (yes i pulled that outta of my ass) developers are security laymen. Just because someone has used pki and hashing functions in projects does not make them even remotely qualified.

At the end of the day, most developers have to rely on some rando internet security pro's ""approval"". Even if a 3rd party security audit was performed by a company, you'll have to trust them. You have to trust ***someone*** somewhere if you do not know enough by yourself.

I've already seen idiots with passing knowledge of crypto basics rant on and on about their ""privacy concerns"".

Agree with all that you have typed. I was willing to give up part of my privacy and take up the risks to try out the app but the battery drain stopped me from continuing using it lol.

=== Author: eviltofu===
If I were to design this, I would not broadcast the phone number. I would generate a 512 or 1024 bit number for the ID and associate this ID with the phone number on the secured server end.

My disagreements with you happen on the following levels:

1. The attacks you describe are very sophisticated and difficult attacks to do. If you had that capability you wouldn't want to do it against a bunch of random people taking public transport and get close to them while looking shifty AF.

2. You can pad the length of any string to make it longer, and you can salt passwords before they get encrypted.

3. I am not a government employee. If I was you can hold these words against me in a court of law. I am just someone who sees the benefit of this app and am invested because I have vulnerable people I care about. I want this virus to be contained.

=== Author: AureBesh123===
OP sounds suspiciously like a GovTech shill

=== Author: Lethaldart===
I mean this app only tries to work with other devices with the app installed, so yes in theory this app will steal your money, wife, kids and dog, but if we are looking at a realistic expectation of what will happen, it is for contact tracing. You can uninstall it after the crisis is over, or even before.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
In an ideal world I agree completely. But I've looked at the principles under which it operates. There isn't anything inherently scary about bluetooth. If they open source, all the better. But I will be safer rather than sorry with the app.

There are times when we can take an adversarial view of what the government is doing, but I don't think that making a big fuss over a bluetooth enabled app is the right time. I think I would take the very small, marginal chance of surveillance over the risk to my family by not participating in one of the better solutions to contact tracing.

I suspect that what the flow looks like is something like this.

When you register your phone number, it goes into their database and an entry is made, and then your number is encrpyted on their server, and they give you this encrypted number to exchange during your bluetooth token sharing. Then when a positive infection is made and they determine that you are a high risk individual, they decrypt the tokens and call you.

=== Author: retaki===
>As a software engineer, ""trust me"" isn't good enough.

I agree with you.

But this is not a random person coming up with an app and inviting everyone to use it. The tracetogether app is backed by the Sg govt. Thus, ""trust me"" by Sg govt is trustworthy for me.

&#x200B;

> The only way I would trust it is if the code is open source. 

I quote my reply to another comment on this thread.

>I also like to add while there are popular software that are open-sourced nowadays, I have never heard about the past govt-developed apps like SGSecure and Health 365 releasing their source code. So, it won't be surprising to me if this app does not become open source.

Also, from my own experience as a computer engineering graduate, I do not think that it is possible to find open source program / codes for everything we use. I think most of us just have to accept the fact that there are many programs that will remain proprietary software.

=== Author: Varantain===
> The only way I would trust it is if the code is open source.

You need to trust that it's securely deployed to App Store/Play Store/F-Droid as well, which is much harder.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Here. Full Disclosure: I am not working with the Singapore Government to provide this service, I am just a concerned person who wants to dispel fears and educate people on the utility of this app. It is so intelligent in its approach it's almost ridiculous levels of effective and yet privacy conscious. Its the ""One like = One Prayer"" app, downloading it can save the lives of the vulnerable.

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043543473-How-does-TraceTogether-work-

We use the Bluetooth Relative Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings between devices across time to approximate the proximity and duration of an encounter between two users.

=== Author: code_wombat===
\>  Secondly, given the size and space of Singapore's phone number, digits size of 8, each from 0 to 9, it is rather quick to brute force to calculate all hashes, even if the hashing is implemented correctly indeed.

All ~~Most~~ security conscious usages of hashing would add a salt to mitigate rainbow attacks.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
You ever hear of salting or padding? I am sure that's something the engineers have been doing as well. No need to be so angry about what I am trying to simplify for a general audience.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)

=== Author: Lethaldart===
It is quite unlikely. There are an army of developers and technology hobbyists who extensively modify their phones. They can read process memory and flag out what seems suspicious to them. Bluetooth is a short ranged signal. It cannot phone home to a server constantly. You only send information when requested by MOH.

Maybe you are able to track a confirm case location movement if you throw in the resource and manpower . But doubt you can trace the close contacts near him. To me this is more a supplement, but will not be main method of tracing. Just getting more contact in case of some that seep through the crack.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
I really empathize with you when you are wary of potential spyware. I understand it completely, but I do wish to correct the attitude that 'any app cannot be trusted'. This is patently false, If you use instagram, twitter, facebook, google, they know more about you than you know about yourself. 

This app is limited to bluetooth and your phone number. Please reconsider your decision so we can work together to defeat this virus! If there are any specific questions I can address so that you and others reading this can trust this app, please ask and I will try my very best to be objective about it so you can be informed about the decisions you make.

=== Author: jigaopuaysi===
Exactly! I don't doubt that the intentions behind this app are noble, but there are just so many ethical questions behind it that people are not thinking about.

=== Author: tehtf===
Not saying you are wrong, but for 4. Although this maybe invasion of privacy, under Singapore infectious act law, MOH has right to ask you disclose information for disease containment/tracing, so is really just ask you (may not remember, too sick no ability to talk) or check your phone.

And I think the govtech has given their reasoning and philosophy behind the app, so at least I would like to say they are clean and meant what they say, given Sg gov past track records and actions for the pandemic. Willing to put faith in them given their past goodwills. (if is china/US gov asking their citizen to install this, I would be as skeptical as you)

Though is also your right to be skeptical and vigilant and inform other of the potential risk/consequence if govtech hide something or malice party hijacking the innocent app data. At least if ppl install it, they have a glimpse of potential IT risk vs helping faster contact tracing in this pandemic period.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Well I don't doubt it, but we are forgetting we can turn off the app and delete it whenever we want, so if you really feel uneasy at any time you can remove it.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
There exists a compromise between having to watch everyone completely and not watching at all. The analogy I will use is like if everyone had a little coin tin they carried around all the time, and everyone you met would deposit a token inside. The more you stay with them, the more tokens they deposit.

This token is some strange alphanumeric string, and the tin can slit is only big enough and shaped in a special way that only those specially shaped tokens can be put in. If the government finds someone ill with the virus, they will open up the tin with their special key, and then read the specially encoded alphanumeric string with their own special cipher. 

This special cipher is a very strong encryption. It is only feasible to break this encryption if you have the master key, which only the government possess. All your other concerns are valid, but very very unlikely to happen.

 All app/playstore applications must be approved, and they are also digitally signed. Even when you logged in to reddit today to comment, you also received signed digital certificates which were approved by a ""CA"" or certificate authority to prove that it was reddit, and not a malicious site. Please trust the process. It works and operates on well defined and understood cryptographic principles.

=== Author: etlgr===
The only data that TraceTogether collect is your mobile number so that MOH can contact you more quickly if you were in close proximity to a COVID-19 case.

It's for contact tracing before declared confirm case la.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
In theory yes, what you describe is indeed feasible, because if we are to be placed under a quarantine order and our phone was detected outside of our homes, then that would raise questions of you breaking the law. However, I do not believe that is the intention of this app, even if this is incidentally one of its use cases.

However, the cost of breaking quarantine here is one of life and death. We do not quarantine lightly, and I think that there ought to be punishment for those who break the rules. If in fact they had spread the disease willfully, even if there was no app, they would be caught and punished. There are no shortage of CCTVs and patrols to help ensure compliance to the laws anyway.

Apple may allow special permission so that the app can run in the background, maybe it'll be updated soon. I don't know exactly how apple's policies are enforced but I am quite sure that they will relax them if it proves that this app is an effective defense against a life threatening illness.

Unlikely. Assuming it’s written correctly, the OS will do the scanning and sending of beacons between devices. And usually both iOS and Android are pretty conservative about it.

And the actual radio comms does using BLE takes very very little battery.

If you are talking about the app running on Android, it's not a flaw but by design. 

Google made it impossible to run background tasks like this.

Yeah I think the notifications are there so they can constantly keep the app alive to scan for bluetooth devices. Its not perfect, and I hope they can improve on that.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
As far as I know, it will not affect the functionality of the app. In fact they designed this app with the idea of power conservation in mind, so it seems like it will work even if on low power mode.

I think the effective curvature of this solution will resemble a tanh curve. It will be good if we can get more and more people on it. For every person who is infected and goes on to infect 3 more, if we do not catch all 3, the r0 of the virus will remain higher than 1, which means infections will keep growing, albeit at a less than exponential rate. Ideally we have enough installs that the infection rates remain at 1 or less, so we 'flatten the curve' so to speak.

I mean at the end of the day, you trust google to protect you, you trust dbs to not steal your money. I want to explain the theory to you, but I think it would take very long. Basically, the phone app stores are designed to not allow malicious apps to be put on them, but sometimes things slip through. 

However, this is a government approved app, and the government can already monitor all your things without this app. There is no advantage to having this app, which uses bluetooth to monitor you. They can already do so via 3g/4g/wifi/cctv/other things. 

I studied tech so when I say I trust them, you can take it with a pinch of salt. At the end of the day, if you do not trust them you don't need to install. I am not paid to promote, I just study this topic and I feel that this is one of the best solutions out there for this virus.

This is empirically not true.  You can still be tracked if base stations are set up (malls, MRT stations, MRT carriage, taxis, grab vehicles) or known users with GPS enabled walk around with a modified version of the app.  You walk past any of these and your cell can be tracked within a few metres, in real time.  I don't think any of this is or will be deployed but it would seem trivially easy to do.  
The government can't currently track you with great accuracy through cellphone towers alone, otherwise this app wouldn't be necessary - apparently additional equipment is required for that which we do not have due to cost and privacy concerns, unlike the Israelis.

I think to drive up adoption it's important not to sugar coat things, less transparency breeds more distrust.

No comment here on the relevance for virus tracking and case tracking. 
I’m a software developer and I’m referring also to the matters of privacy and security, where open source is a proven model. Apple verification is good and getting better but has been found to have its weaknesses simply for the massive number of apps to review.

=== Author: sangrilla===
I would like to know the numerous reason not to release the code? This has the potential violate privacy and asking people to trust the app because virus is not a good argument.

You are asking the public to trust the app base on what you said but refuse to trust the public with the source.

=== Author: yupidup===
I don’t know most developers (aren’t they millions?). 

I’ll speak for myself, I had security audit, I‘m well aware I’m not proficient in security, thus the demand for having it open sourced so somebody else get a more proficient look at it. 

As a coder I trust no one and certainly not myself, I always want peer review if the code is critical, I’m looking for a level of certainty in the code not trust in person X or Y. Certainty is not black or white, but the higher the number of reviewers, improve and testers, the higher the certainty that the final code is hard to crack. 

If it’s not open source, the alternative is that we put our trust in the app developer only. They may be incredible coders, but we all makes mistakes. 

Also they’re trying so save us here so I’m sure they could use some help at some point, which is possible with open source.

Stay safe y’all, and enjoy that oddly good life we still can have in SG.

=== Author: yupidup===
It’s actually a miss conception about security.
Let me add some precision: the code should be open source. Encryption security is based on encryption keys which are to be never shared. 
So the code is harden by peer reviews, basically anybody can try to find how to break it and then improve it. Most software encryption library are open source today (ssl, etc).

The practical equivalent of this open system is that everybody knows how most door lock are designed, but that doesn’t help you open it unless you got the key.

Tbh my concern is how many friends are asking me this morning if they can trust the app instead of installing it. I want to dispel any form of doubts, not talking about conspiracy theory that will probably emerge. This doubt is harmful

=== Author: Caninomancy===
If the app is only secure if you hide the vulnerabilities, it isn't secure.

There's a reason why security through obscurity is a bad practice.

=== Author: jigaopuaysi===
It sounds counterintuitive, but open source doesn't mean easier to hack actually.

=== Author: BGen_Tan===
You may read up on these two things: Kerckhoff's Principle and its opposite concept, Security by obscurity.

And once you have basic understanding of hashing (including general purpose hash and Key Derivative Functions, KDF) and encryption (there are two types: symmetric key and assymetric key cryptography, latter which is also called Public Key Infrastructure, PKI), you can also look into security whitepapers of Whatsapp, Telegram, 1Password, Authy, etc. They published their implementation out in the open even though sometimes they are proprietary. So they spell out specifically how they use SHA, AES, bcrypt, etc.

Then you'll realize why they openly do that. To put it simply, is to openly use an algorithm mathematically and practically (requires huge amount of hardware power not available today, or too long of computing time) proven to be infeasible to crack, and to say that ""I indeed used the currently proven method yet to be cracked""

(For those really specializes in this to the point of actually hacking or bounty hunting: Hope this is good enough for anyone of any background to start understanding the basics. This is likely peanuts for you.)

To quote a 2013 [zdnet article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/six-open-source-security-myths-debunked-and-eight-real-challenges-to-consider/)

>  
>""I've done a lot of work on this, there's no objective evidence either way. On average, good open source is about as good as good proprietary, and \[bad\] about as bad as bad proprietary,"" said Levy.

>Asking whether any piece of software is secure is too broad a question, according to Levy. A more valuable approach, he added, is to ask what security guarantees your organisation wants from a piece of software and then ask whether the software delivers that.

I also like to add while there are popular software that are open-sourced nowadays, I have never heard about the past govt-developed apps like SGSecure and Health 365 releasing their source code. So, it won't be surprising to me if this app does not become open source.

=== Author: Oradious===
Yea, I'd expect them to salt the hash as a security measure minimally. As to the way they salt it, that's where questions will be asked. But since it isn't open-sourced, we wouldn't know for sure, unless someone wants to try and unpack and RE the app.

Measurement via mAh will be more accurate. My phone has rated capacity of 6000 mAh (4700 mAh after I tried measuring my charging with a USB meter) while some people has 3000 mAh, 4000, etc, so your 1.4% could be my 0.7% for example. Plus, devices with BT 5 is supposed to have low consumption compared to those with BLE 4.2

(Mine is a top or so gaming phone from Taiwan on 3DMark lol ... I heard some people can find out and exploit your phone's vulnerability simply by knowing your phone model.)

(Edit to add-on: In reality you never get perfectly rated capacity, as some of you may have noticed. Same for powerbank too. This is due to losses of energy and conversions from rated voltage and circuitry. Read somewhere that your actual capacity is rated capacity * 3.7V/5V. (3.7 is your battery voltage, usually for Li-Ion, and 5V is input (rated? I am not from EE and I suck at electronics in A level physics) voltage of your charger)

My previous Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe started out measured at 2400 mAh against rated 3000 mAh, after 2 years of usage dropped to 1800 mAh.

Yup, PKI would make sense, because the public key can be stored locally on clients. I suspect that's the case because it would take criminal levels of incompetence to store MOH's private key locally. Perhaps the website just didn't want to go overboard with technical details.

Just like with password. From the OP none of this is mentioned though. I just started verifying and looking into source code of the app so I will comment more later, so just now when I share this to a friend it was over a casual chat because my friend also enjoys reading up technical stuffs and sometimes roasting other comments (sometimes for laughs over incompetence of others). Me, I just wanna have a proper fact based discussion

Should edit to all security conscious. No point without salt, nowadays is so easy to break with the amount of computing power a normal consumer device have.

=== Author: BGen_Tan===
I'm not angry ... and as I said, my friend (and actually, the former circle I had in the university which I left), while very clever, unfortunately the clique I was in also spent free time roasting things and generally being toxic so I left. So I was just sharing with him for his critical analysis. For me I do wish no malice.

In my company we sometimes have security awareness session, it took me 6 sessions across 2 years (1 hour each per session) to teach really basic stuffs about their data protection rights, encryption and hashing, etc. to everyone including those not from IT, the funds people, the legal colleagues, etc (Nearly all the maths removed, with key essentials to know about how HTTPs work for example. It helps that I set up my own NAS and protocols at home to simplify what I share). So I am also slowly raising such awareness to people not from Computer Science background.  


(Edit: and oh "" I am trying to simplify for a general audience ""  
I'll be upfront and say Statistics and Probability is my weakest and hated part of mathematics my whole life. That's me, sure, but putting down the concept of independent events from this portion of math is not quite laymen for the rest of others I'm afraid...we just need the app to work as it is stated, so there is no need to be so defensive about it)

=== Author: WikiTextBot===
**Salt (cryptography)**

In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.

I don't use social media or grab/gojek as well. Even this account is a throwaway. Any app cannot be trusted.. And you can only mitigate security risks. Then why take on unnecessary risks and increased battery drain when there's no need to?

  I do recall that details of thousands of Singaporean patients were leaked from ihis before, so there's already a precedent. 

Has anyone considered cases where we are supposed to deposit our phones at certain locations (e.g. Red zones in army camps)? Just because phones are in close proximity doesn't mean their owners are the same as well.

=== Author: hosehliao===
So is it voluntary to give up your data from this app if you are infected?
If the government can force you to disclose data and check your phone to prevent a disease, then this isn't really voluntary anymore, unless you don't download it.

Then what if you download it, and you get infected, and you forget where you've been, will they use this app data to say you've been lying?

=== Author: CSlv===
Assuming they are using PKI and the key isn't the issue, then the only weakness left is the implementation libraries. Not every platform implements the AES standard to a T, so it is a matter of time before a well equipped and well determined bad person breaks your special coin slot.

I am also not referring to bad people uploading a malware loaded TraceTogether onto the app store. It leaves too much of a trail. I'm concerned about bad people having a fake TraceTogether app on their own devices and using it as a platform to extract the supposedly anonymised information. Worse, since the app is *exchanging* information, it will be even worse if that bad person uses this vector to deposit their own malware onto your phone. Your phone is always beaconing out and requesting for and accepting anonymous contact details (i.e. data).

Again, we're seriously banking on the fact that 1) this thing blows over and people start deleting the app before an adversary finds a way in OR 2) the adversary gives up because they're also stuck at home and the ROI to exploit this is deemed too low.

That doesn't clarify my point about how there are people who might be infected and not know about it. Keeping in mind there's a 14 days incubation period of infection without symptoms and confirmed cases must be incubated. Before or after confirm cases doesn't make a difference unless I'm missing something out then you may feel free to enlighten me.

=== Author: cereszal===
Just to clarify, I'm not implying that this app has the intention to capture those who are breaking the law.

If I understand correctly, there are already other implementations to catch such persons - such as sending SMS, reporting GPS locations, etc.

Considering that this app's intention is to not trace those who leave their quarantine areas, I still don't understand how it could help?Especially if we keep in mind about these important groups of people who might/might not use this app:

* Those unaware they were infected or in contact with those infected
* Supposed quarantined persons of those in contact with an infected person
* Quarantined infected person

The only thing I can think of is that if there is an infected person, all their contact plus and users might get a message like this: ""Have you been in contact with this person x? If so, please go to the doctor immediately.""

This was not clear in the video/website so I am probably assuming a lot of things here. But if I'm right, it does make sense and this should be a clear point for the app.   
Otherwise, there would be others who won't see the use of this app as I've pointed out and you might understand the reason behind my point.

> you can keep the app running in the background. If the system detects that your app hasn't been working for at least 24 hours, it will send you a notification with instructions on how to troubleshoot. Hope this helps.

A little vague - doesn't really address whether or not the bluetooth handshake is going on even in the background.  I haven't received any notification and I've got the app installed for about 12 hours so far.

=== Author: samglit===
One can hope, since this isn’t particularly invasive in data collection.  Although some security guy in Apple could rightly point out that relying on network effects to track location is still location tracking - i.e. all it would take is to have a modified version of the app running on android that ALSO has GPS enabled (or has known locations) and place them in every mrt station, train carriage, in taxis, random cars, and police/Cisco security officers.

Suddenly you don’t need GPS to trace where citizens have been any more.

No, I am aware of the risks. I am just of the opinion that the risks are missing the forests for the trees. It's like being afraid of dying from chemotherapy treatment instead of cancer.

 The entire reason why this app exists and was released is because someone at govtech thought long and hard and said okay, lets release this app. They will have accounted for the risk and releasing it implicitly is a sign of confidence. That is not to say the risks don't exist, but that they are so small and pale in comparison to the real threat, which is the virus.

I also studied tech (not compsci) and unfortunately I disagree. In fact tech has nothing to do with it.

> However, this is a government approved app, and the government can already monitor all your things without this app. There is no advantage to having this app, which uses bluetooth to monitor you. They can already do so via 3g/4g/wifi/cctv/other things. 

Going by this logic - 
When you go overseas (hopefully not any time soon), do you bother locking your luggage? It's really easy to defeat those locks, so there's no need for a lock. In fact your house door lock can be picked, why bother locking your door? 

Yes, the government has other ways to track you. But every additional bit of data can be aggregated to give an even better picture of people. Yes, good things can be done with it, and bad things can also be done with it. 

Say hypothetically, during contact tracing, they realise that one of the infected happens to stay next door to someone who was radicalised and is planning to blow up Istana. Would you let them use the Trace Together data?

Now say it wasn't a potential terrorist but a murderer. Would you?

Then what if it wasn't a murderer, but a loanshark?

What about using it for political purposes?

There's a slippery slope here, and while we're nowhere near what most people define as ""unacceptable"", we're slowly heading down that path.

Oh, and sure, they say they won't use your data unnecessarily. But this is the Government, which decides what is ""necessary"". PDPA doesn't apply to them.

=== Author: jigaopuaysi===
#PSA: If you download TraceTogether, the government has the power to force you to hand over the data

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-develops-smartphone-app-for-efficient-contact-tracing

*""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act""*

See, this is another ethical issue I just found out about. Downloading the app is voluntary but at the point of infection, that choice is taken away from you. 

And then what if you genuinely couldn't remember where you were, and thought you were at home when you were at Orchard, will you be prosecuted based on discrepancies with the app logs?

=== Author: racife===
Bruh... so far your argument hinges on the thinking that the app is trustworthy because its from the government.

Technically they already can, with Wireless@SGx hotspots and SIM authentication. Each time your phone associates your identity is made known via 802.1x authentication, and these APs are found in exactly those places you mentioned. This is assuming you keep WiFi on, which if you are using iPhone can actually be quite challenging to turn off...

=== Author: Lethaldart===
The question is, what is the motive in order to do so? The government knows everything about you from birth, they've got a million cctv camera in place, what else can they stand to gain from having a bluetooth enabled app on your phone? 

Like you pointed out, the phones already use 3/4g which allow you to triangulate your position. If indeed they are tracking you, it's a fait accompli. Its already being done, and they don't need this app to do it. This app is exactly what it says, for contact tracing. Please consider this context before being worried!

Yes but if we step back from our knowledge of best software practices and look at the real world, there is a virus which threatens to kill and chronically injure people for a very, very long time.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Sure, I think they would open source if there was enough interest, but I think that they have had some commercial interests develop the app so some proprietary software might not be available, legally speaking, for open source. I completely agree that if they can, they should. 

As for trusting the government, I would say that if you do not trust them with an app on your phone, why would you trust them with anything at all? CPF, Taxes, the numerous CCTV, police patrols. 

Honestly it feels like this temporary app is making everyone very conscious of themselves, but in reality we already make so many implicit decisions daily to trust them. If anything this app is so limited in scope it is the one thing I would trust them more with, than any other thing.

=== Author: snarky-monkey===
I'm not opposed to open sourcing the code. In fact, I'm for it. Was just tired of the not-so-rare chumps who've read 3 blog posts on crypto, then start opening bugs against open source projects to crap on non-issues.

Perhaps I didn't make it clear, but I am against the mentality that somehow open sourcing the app would magically make it safe, because *someone else will look at it and* ***confirm guarantee chop stamp*** *that it is safe*.

That promotes a false sense of security. We cannot expect the entire world's developers to scrutinize our niche app. We can only rely on Singaporeans, or those residing here, which is a *much much* smaller pool (definitely **not** anywhere near millions). We, however, remain a potential target for the entire worlds' black hats.

I think you should discuss with the development team at their official feedback email [support@tracetogether.gov.sg](mailto:support@tracetogether.gov.sg).

Le sigh, OP basically went emotional on my side of reply. Thank you for bothering to typing this whole thing out.  


The thing that OP gotten right is the operational procedure and culture for the agency doing this app.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Is the fear about being hacked disproportionate to the benefit of the app? I think it is. Yes of course we can be hacked, but we have to weigh the cost and benefits against each other. 

I've decided that this app is safe, and even if it is not safe, I have also thought about it and I think that contact tracing is something essential to rally behind. Please consider this context when you are deciding to download or not download the app!

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Oh yeah that's kinda dumb, I agree. But still I think having some shorter battery life in order to achieve better contact tracing is a really positive thing. I would trade all my battery if it meant I could protect loved ones from infection.

=== Author: Lapmlop2===
Battery drop by 10% in an hour  since I use this. Don't use Bluetooth usually. Not good.

=== Author: Thorberry===
I have no interest in defending the app (or attacking it), but at least for new versions of the iPhone, Bluetooth is turned on by default. If you try to turn it off in Control Center it just disconnects devices until the next day (i.e., bluetooth actually remains powered on).

I would be surprised if any significant number of iPhone users go into their Settings to turn it off manually.

=== Author: isparavanje===
It's not really that dumb because a lot of people have Bluetooth on all the time due to fitness trackers or headphones. They're just saying there won't be much additional battery drain on top of that.

=== Author: whitechickenrice===
yeap! I saw another comment there might be an algorithm to calculate distance &duration of contact with this BLE so I'm really curious how it works

> Or you can compile it and run it yourself.

When we have the source code, yes.

It's also possible to self-sign and sideload it on iOS.

=== Author: code_wombat===
Is the source code for the app released already ?

=== Author: BGen_Tan===
Add-on: I just have access to a laptop, I was on app. Could not find source code link. But I know someone from the department actually but he lazy to explain on his FB so he also quoted this link too. I am asking him if open source is possible.

=== Author: code_wombat===
True. Fixed.

Also you'd be surprised how many engineer, or people just started making websites out of interest, didn't even implement the basics of security.

As a Malaysian, I can easily point you to some of our state government websites with login system that still don't have https. Probably not even SHA-2 hashing clientside and KDFs on server side.

Well I understand your concerns for privacy, but I have to tell you, if you've used any form of social media, you've got a digital footprint that no amount of worrying about bluetooth and temporary apps will help resolve. I am very privacy conscious too, but in this interconnected world, we have to accept that sometimes things must be more open than closed. In this case, bluetooth is a short ranged signal. You have apps on your phone which track you day and night. They're facebook, instagram, twitter, and hell, even your browser too.

=== Author: youtubertan===
Basically the question becomes ""do you trust the govt to spy/not spy on you?""

We all have our own answers..

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Well this might be slightly concerning to you... but if you've ever studied network traffic, I have to tell you that all your browsing habits, unless you've been on a VPN for the last 10 years, are completely available for capture and recording. The app wouldn't be necessary to do surveillance. 

The fact that this app exists is a testament to the fact that while we do conduct surveillance, that it is only applied in cases where you truly represent a security risk. If not, why would they ask people to download this app? Why wouldn't they just use their hidden infrastructure to assist MOH in contact tracing?

The app is the smallest thing w.r.t privacy. The biggest privacy concerns you have are actually things which you cannot even perceive, such as your MAC address on your pc, and phone. You can hide behind a hundred proxies or even your VPN, but if someone is really dedicated to tracking you, then there is no stopping them. 

They wouldn't need this app to do it. Furthermore, you're not an important person. No one cares what websites you visit, or who you talk to, unless those happen to be terrorist related. Furthermore, this app uses bluetooth, which is a low-range signal. It can only travel 10 meters at best, so I think your fears w.r.t this app are overblown. If you cannot trust this app, I think you'd also have to avoid all forms of cashless payments, never renew your passport, wear a mask, and sunglasses, never sign any documents, pay no taxes, and have no address haha

=== Author: Varantain===
> So is it voluntary to give up your data from this app if you are infected? If the government can force you to disclose data and check your phone to prevent a disease, then this isn't really voluntary anymore, unless you don't download it.

The Straits Times themselves have made it clear that [you open yourself up to culpability under the Infectious Diseases Act](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-develops-smartphone-app-for-efficient-contact-tracing) if you use the app and refuse to upload the data after:

> When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
And do you think in this time of a pandemic that cybercriminals are roaming about with massive bluetooth hijacking setups in order to walk next to what is potentially another virus carrier? You have to be within bluetooth range and you have to handshake with the right authentication or permission for bluetooth access. I would take my chances with that over the possible spread of COVID19, which is a clear, imminent danger and proven threat. 

This other problem you describe exists in theory, but not in practice. Even if it did exist in practice, the level of sophistication means that these attacks will not be against a random stranger on the MRT, but against targeted, high value individuals who are.... not using public transport.

As of right now I think you do need the phone to be kept switched on in order for the bluetooth to work, but I cannot be sure. You should follow their FAQ website for updates, as I am not the developer. 

https://tracetogether.zendesk.com/hc/en-sg/articles/360043777394-What-is-the-power-saver-mode-on-iOS-devices-

I would also encourage people from your age group to watch the news for updates and possibly informative content from our government concerning our strategy against COVID19, which may include this app.

=== Author: ImpossibleAnger===
Some people were only confirmed and isolated after showing symptoms for a few days, especially those who kept seeing different doctors. They would have been going about their daily lives - maybe next to you in the MRT, or at your neighbourhood zichar joint for dinner. Without this app it would be almost impossible to track down the people they were in close proximity to outside structured settings like work, church, school etc

=== Author: danielling1981===
This is to help them contact trace for 14 or 21 days before they become confirm case.

What do you not get about it?

Before becoming confirm = they don't know about it yet.

Once they become confirm, the contact tracing data can be download from the app for use.

To put it even more simply.

You download the app today. X days later, you become confirm case. You have X days of contact tracing data since the day you download the app.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
So the principle of contact tracing, as I understand it, is to find individuals who are at high risk of exposure to the virus. That's why duration and proximity are important. 

It also can provide additional contextual nuanced information to MOH. If somehow, lets say you have no known prior community spreads, and you possibly sat next to an infected person. 

Without this app, it would have been a dead end, and MOH would be left wondering if there was a cluster they might not have found. If your app indicates you were sitting next to that person on the MRT for 20 minutes, they might go with that hypothesis over wasting time looking useless leads. 

Time is of the essence when it comes to contact tracing. Every minute delayed is another person exposing themselves to more and more people.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
No, I am not. I just happen to be very enthusiastic about this project. Even if I was the developer, don't you think that me being so blatantly positive about it would be suspicious and thus out me as having an ulterior motive? I am truly enthusiastic about this effort.

I think android has a much larger installed base in Singapore so the app will still be effective even if iPhone users don’t participate continuously in large numbers.

=== Author: samglit===
Govtech FB says that the app will still run in the background (like IOS apps) but didn't actually clarify that the bluetooth handshaking would happen.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
We should also note that you can uninstall and turn off bluetooth at any time once the virus has subsided. It is not integrated into a number of apps, like facebook's location services which compel you to use them if you want to use facebook for example. It is a standalone, so its easy to remove and easy to stop.

=== Author: Lapmlop2===
Yes. But you didn't point out the risks in your opening posts. The down votes only occurs  when others pointed out the risks and you reacted to defend your stand or downplay them not your original post. Not saying that what you are doing is bad but that the down voting reaction is justified.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Well you don't have to download the app... If you disagree with it fundamentally please don't feel pressured to download it. I just am trying to make as clear as possible why I think it is safe and effective.

=== Author: omgnuts===
This logic is taken out of context & misconstruing the wholesome purpose of the app. What OP just says is that there is no advantage for the govt to need this app to monitor you for illicit purposes, if they wanted. They have enough monitoring for that. 

There are pro/cons to every solution, and this app if used wisely, makes lot of sense targeting at this growing anomaly. I’m not sure why the radical terrorist / murderer / criminal / scammers would be silly enough to use the app. But if this app has a secondary purpose, it makes even more sense to me. Political purposes? This sounds like a desperate move, and the reputation risk is too high. Aside, I don’t think the sitting party is politically desperate - in fact, its probably otherwise but let’s not digress. 

Granted, there are probably a lot of real situations that will reveal itself overtime. But the app design logically makes sense right now, and respects user privacy. 

If you think carefully about i - This tracing is a granular trace that probably includes the parameters of both time & distance - eg they would eventually filter all the contacts you made via public transport. Each contact link data is stored locally & deleted after 21 days. It protects you as much as the other party using it. 

Now, this data is uploaded for analysis only when a user turns into a COVID-19 victim, with consent. If someone you came into contact with us COVID-19 positive, you can be contacted if both of you were using the app! Primary & secondary contact links can then be established using basic search algorithms. 

Privacy is used to protect you, but being overtly protective of privacy can also hurt you.

Edit: Grammar..

This is the reason why I didn't download the app. Volunteering to take on the burden of possible prosecution is a non-starter for me.

posted this somewhere else, but...

##PSA: If you download TraceTogether, the government has the power to force you to hand over the data

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-singapore-develops-smartphone-app-for-efficient-contact-tracing

""When contacted by contact tracers, that is the point that users will be asked to share their data logs. If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act""

See, this is another ethical issue I just found out about. Downloading the app is voluntary but at the point of infection, that choice is taken away from you.

And then what if you genuinely couldn't remember where you were, and thought you were at home when you were at Orchard, will you be prosecuted based on discrepancies with the app logs?

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Well I think this virus is a very difficult problem to solve, and this app is one of the best solutions for a long term, sustainable approach to protecting Singapore. Please don't think I don't have my own private concerns. I just feel that at this time, we have more pressing matters to focus on.

I would not be surprised by a phase 2 roll out asking businesses to cooperate - it would make sense for buses and MRT carriages to implement this as well if adoption rate is high.  It would make contact tracing far easier.

Isnt it always a good idea to talk about how much trust you put in the government (and other big companies like Google and Apple)? Some things the government does we have to accept, but you shouldn't blindly accept everything they do.

Case in point, cctvs which you mentioned - police used to install cctvs to catch crime and loansharks and lift molest cases. Then they started installing cctv at roads to monitor traffic. Then they started using cctv to catch people smoking or throwing litter. What if they suddenly decide to use cctv to catch jaywalkers?

I'm glad you brought up cost and benefits, I forgot to talk about that. 

Look at our current contact tracing efforts. We've already been doing so well. What additional benefit does this bring? This is mostly helpful for transient contact (ie you walk past someone who just got infected), but contact tracing is supposed to be for sustained contact anyway (<2m for 30min or something like that).

And the costs, I think enough people have raised concerns in this thread (including myself) so i won't repeat it. But basically, marginal extra benefit for what I consider to be a high long-term cost.

Sure, but there are also many (probably more) people who don't normally have Bluetooth on and are looking for some information about this, and this piece of information only makes it look like they're trying to downplay how much of a battery hit this app is going to cost them...

Hi wombat, the summary of conversation with my pal (I will post again as main comment):

1. There has been plans for citizens to contribute, no promises though. I saw another user pointed this out somewhere down here.
2. Note that the agency has Compliance to follow too, they as personal capacity and opinions had to take down their statement from time to time
3. Traditionally the govt prefers Security over Obscurity. (Starting from here is my opinion for this point 3): So cultural change may be needed to help promoting open-source it seems. Just as per another agency friend mentioned. BTW OP's comment checks out on this one.
4. For this one, for my pal's sake, I will just put it this way: Some details need to be ironed out before open-source is possible. Just think along the whole process of developing and publish the app and you'll see what is involved and needs to be discussed.

We can consider the hypothetical scenario that the app has traced someone and sends a message of those suspected.

I assume only some of these people would have symptoms but would be advised to quarantine themselves immediately.

If my assumption is right, I didn't see anything like this on the website, video or OP. The reason I pointed this out is that if more people understood the contradictions I've raised, they would be more willing to download the app and tell everyone to do so.

=== Author: cereszal===
It wasn't mentioned on the website, video or OP.

Many people won't take the initiative to download the app since that was the case.

=== Author: cereszal===
>If somehow, lets say you have no known prior community spreads, and you possibly sat next to an infected person. 

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

Your point of making it easy for contacts to be found as well as my idea of notifying contacted people to visit the doctor could definitely be made clear on the website to increase the probability of downloads.

We can debate the risk all day, but I have chosen to use the app, and I hope many people will to. If I have made an error in judgement I apologize, but I think there is an unhealthy paranoia surrounding what seems to be a good and effective proposal. Please consider that the fears may be disproportionate to how good this app potentially is, and how important it is for us to have a strong networking effect, which means we need as many users as we can get on board.

If you disagree with /u/jigaopuaysi's points, you can further strengthen your arguments on _why_ we should download TraceTogether by engaging them in a discussion, instead of saying ""don't like, don't download/use"".

=== Author: jigaopuaysi===
You missed the point of my argument. I'm not saying that TT data is definitely going to be used for political purposes (i said ""hypothetically"").

My point is that everything the government is doing, including this, is slowly but surely expanding the boundaries of what data they can collect on us, and how they can use it.

The hypothetical examples were meant to illustrate how much leeway the government has currently, and how the data can potentially be used. 

Straits Times has already said that if you are infected, the consent is taken away from you and you will be compelled to give it up.

Once you consent to the data being uploaded (or, in the case of contact tracing, the data is forcibly taken from you), you can no longer control how it is used. Private sector has laws on how data can be used, and it's enforced in the PDPA. Government is exempt from these laws, and not just for security purposes.

So that's why we should not be downloading this app - we should not be allowing the government to continue to push the boundaries of what is acceptable without proper discussion, using the virus as an excuse. The benefit of this app is marginal at best - the Government has already said that transient contact is not dangerous, and hence contact tracing is only done for sustained contact (<2m for >30min?). The current interview process works, and it has even weeded out liars, so the additional benefit of this app is questionable.

That's fair, but I think in the Singapore context, and with respect to the Singapore subreddit, our most effective tool has been contact tracing. We do not want to end up like Italy, and so I think this message is for Singaporeans and others who are similarly minded about techniques. There is a lot of doubt and its okay to have doubt, but when we weigh the costs and benefits I think an app like this is far better than not having it.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
This isn't some semantic game of 'gotcha'. That was my hypothesis on why they might not have open sourced it yet. It's all speculation about why it isn't open sourced. It could also be ""no approval yet"".

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Having the app for a large number of the population will speed up contact tracing efforts, which will minimize the spread of the virus. In addition, the statboards of MOH and Govtech have performed their own risk analysis and decided that the app is a good thing to release. With that context in mind, to me at least, I am confident it is a safe, secure and effective tool.

=== Author: tehtf===
For the contact tracing part I think can chip in a bit. By definition alone, those on public transport (<2m for >30 min) should also be consider close contact. But it is out of the list purely because it is not feasible to do. (How you know in mrt where you and the case stands? In buses are you sitting far apart or sitting beside? You and case highly likely don’t even know each other for the contact tracers to try getting your contact)

With this app installed, at least there will be some more ppl that will be inform and check upon during contact tracing, especially if case travel using public transport. The list maybe marginal but letting one more ppl to be aware of his risk with possible contact of virus is always better.

Though to me battery drainage is a practical concern lol

=== Author: tehtf===
You may want to change your comment above. Don’t Baotou your friend if ppl want to trace him. If really did let you see and you find some critical area for improvement, can let him know for “version update”.

What I interested to know is what kind of info (encrypted) is recorded. Hp#, date/time, duration of close proximity, is there any other information collected/recorded in the log for upload?

=== Author: BGen_Tan===
I'm sure my pals at GovTech are working hard too. However all organizations will always need to start somewhere, with incidents or not, as I understand they are also a few years old.

What matters is the community to sit down and voice their security concerns and improve on that if it exists.

There is no need to explode in such a geek pride all of a sudden that I see in pretty much every tech forums or blog comments of any experts, or to be emotionally attached to our competency. It doesn't reinforce your point, given now not even code is released. And I am not here to slam you. There is also no need to give an attitude like some of the players (toxic or not) similar to playing with noobs or new players on Dota or Rainbow Six Siege when dealing with inexperienced people.

I think its more about ""If there are some people who are asymptomatic spreaders"" we can find them and stop them by quarantining them so they do not pass it on. We don't assume anything about the condition of someone.

 If someone spontaneously falls ill and we don't know how, this app will help with that. Either it will help us isolate those who they caught it from, or it will help us stop it from spreading. Right now its all up in the air as to how much community spread there is, and we do see about 10 new cases daily. 

We need to be faster in catching these people in order to slow the spread. That's where the app is advantageous. It helps us find the contacts faster. Your other suggestions make sense, but they're beyond the scope of this app.

If you want a strong network, then make app installation compulsory, just like NS is compulsory. To sweeten the deal and to lessen the grumbling from paranoid tinfoil hatters, the app authors can, short of going open source for the moment, be brutally transparent about the entire data and metadata process, in a way that security and IT professionals can parse and dumb down for the layman in assorted educational blogs, Quora and Medium articles, newly spawned Reddit threads, and infographics.

That way, you save money on sending untrained and unconvincing personnel to Reddit to persuade the aforementioned paranoid tinfoil hatters.

>using the virus as an excuse

Seriously. Transient contact isn't dangerous now, but it's possible for the virus to mutate. Yes, privacy concern is an issue, but do you really want someone who is infected to be hiding information? 

I have no idea if you realize how dangerous this virus can be - your points about privacy are valid, but in this context, do you not think that you're pushing it too far with your arguments? There's a right time and place for everything.

The government did its own analysis and decided to add a race qualification to the Presidency (even as they said the PM-ship should be race blind), disqualifying a slightly anti-establishment candidate.

The government did its own analysis and decided that they should have POFMA (which is admittedly useful for COVID, but that wasn't their thought process). They also decided some time back to limit the number of hospitals built so people won't go to the hospital that much (which was since reversed).

I could go on, but my point is that you have to exercise your own judgement, and while the government is generally quite rational they sometimes are blind to the consequences of their actions.

Nope, I never seen the code. When I first saw this whole post I was on app and thought the code was available. Now for the past 2 hours able to sit down in front of a PC to scour everything, I only had the official site, this post, and a short convo from my friend and it's mostly just a question of if it will be OS. And it makes sense, how do they make sure they share it securely to me anyways.

And now contemplating about to download the app to see how's it like. Perhaps I'll borrow a phone.

Not just that, but the more data is available, the more you can pinpoint where people are.

If you know where X business is (say in Jewel), and you can track which people walks past the business, you have one point of reference. If you take these people's records, and look at who walked past them in the 5 minutes prior and after they walked past X, you have an idea of who is around Jewel already.

Hi, idk how reliable this is, but my friend who worked at govtech previously said that they are planning to open source for the code soon so ppl can check whether location is used or stored and other countries can use it

=== Author: yupidup===
Is it? It’s from gov tech, and they have some fine coders, so I believe they did it in a pretty clean way actually. The attention put in explaining the authorizations needed when you install show that they are sensitive to these questions.

Erm... just saw the app has to be kept open to work. That almost cancel any debate on privacy and monitoring, but that seriously lowers how much it will be used effectively

=== Author: Lethaldart===
No, what I am disagreeing with you about is the degree to which the government will invade your privacy. Lets agree for one moment that yes, this is an evil malicious app designed to track you. I will play devils advocate and consider the worst case scenario. Okay, so now they're tracking you. But to what purpose? Honestly, I am out of touch with your fears completely.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
I hope that will bring more people on board. I think so many people mistrust lots of technology things, but this app is really such a good solution I can't find much fault with it. Everyone is so paranoid about being tracked but I think they don't realize how easy it is to track them, with or without an app on their phone. That really shouldn't be the concern with respect to the app.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Im just speculating about why you don't open source something instantly. 
Some of the obvious ones are: It contains proprietary softwate.
It hasnt been cleared for open sourcing because it contains private keys.
It hasnt been been approved.
Management at govtech believes in security through obscurity. 
I am in no way condoning this behavior, please don't misunderstand me. I am just pointing out their perspective.

=== Author: samglit===
I don’t fear it at all. Track me all they want. I’ve got the app installed, the **entire point of it is tracking**.  If it doesn’t track, what would be the point?

You are saying that it is not possible to location track without user intervention if the app is installed and used as intended - it’s simply not true.  Any Apple security engineer would immediately say, in order to enable this for iOS we will need some pretty good guarantees that the data won’t be misused; if the G just handwaves it it won’t happen.  Better to get in front of it and layout the full plan.

=== Author: yupidup===
I see your point, I agree that reactivity matters first, put the app out asap and run the verifications to open source it on the background. As for a gov’s entity relationship to obfuscation and transparency I... simply won’t go on the topic online. I’m a foreigner, can’t take any risks with my status here

=== Author: Lethaldart===
No.... it is possible and what you're saying is wrong. It quite literally says in the FAQ they do not know where you are. Unless you're saying that a stat board is making a false statement, in which case that is a very serious accusation. I trust that the information is as correct and complete and made in good faith.

=== Author: samglit===
The FAQ says the app doesn’t track you. True.

It doesn’t say there will be no other apps capable of connecting to you that won’t track you, or that this will not be deployed in future.

I’m not a security expert so if I can think of it, I’m sure there are plenty of others who can as well - better to just rule it out straight away, or explicitly leave the door open for the possibility in future.

The only reason I can think of to use Bluetooth instead of gps like SGSecure is the great accuracy it will give the G to pinpoint proximity.

Also, Apple will not just take the Singapore stat board’s word for it.  It didn’t even trust the NSA for crying out loud - “trust me I’m the government” is a damn poor argument to use with a US corporation.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
Fair enough, if you think the government is evil, don't use the app. I hope most of us who use it can protect you in that case!

=== Author: samglit===
You must be hard of thinking or reading. I said I’m using the app and I want to be tracked.  I think the privacy implications were not thought through before assurances were given (bad), and if we want to get this actually useful on iOS they need to be addressed.

Hand waving to say “if you’re not with us you’re against us” is really stupid, and it won’t work with Apple which has a large market share.

=== Author: Lethaldart===
I didn't say that, I said that you can choose to make any choice you like, including thinking that the government has malicious intent. It seems as if from all your previous comments you think they have some bad intentions, or that this app has a very large risk involved. My position has always been, hey I try to tell everyone its ok to use it. 

If you really feel attacked, I apologize. My intention is to dispel fears. Maybe my language was very strong or rubbed you the wrong way. Please don't misunderstand, I am not a paid shill, government employee, or somehow associated with the project. I am just an enthusiast.

=== Author: samglit===
My issue is the app will be less effective without iOS users on board.  And they can’t get on board without Apple getting on board.  And Apple will not get on board if these concerns are not addressed.  And they are not trivial concerns and require 100% trust in the state.

I’m not sure how much usage data they will collect, since it’s not stated in the FAQ, but assuming they at least check if the app has been used “x” times a day and duration, it will give a clear picture on whether or not to rely on these users.

My experience with users will suggest that they’ll be super enthusiastic the first few days and then forget about it if it’s hard to use.  So better count them out -  and really, deploying base stations makes a ton of sense to increase coverage.  If you offered it to offices, I’d bet my left nut most companies would jump at it to know for sure 100% if staff encountered anyone who was sick.

Was thinking why it only interacts with nearby devices that has the app installed. They could've stored all Bluetooth addresses of nearby devices irregardless of whether the other party installed the app. The person that had contracted virus can then provide their Bluetooth address even if they didn't install the app which can then be used to track if you've been near that particular person, under the assumption that that person had his/her Bluetooth on. This way, u can also check if you've been near someone that contracted coronavirus through the data provided by anothrr person that had already installed the app in the first place. Maybe it's to save battery

Not really an election, cannot say the wrong thing (POFMA), soon the government will have even more data on us.

=== Author: Uranium-Sauce===
Without knowing the exact implementation, there’s no way to tell.

But I imagine the app would store ur movement and transient bluetooth contacts (including their contact # or unique identifier) locally on ur phone. So if you’re a confirmed case, they’ll pull the local data from ur phone in order to extract the previously mentioned contact # or unique identifer and contact every single one of them to inform them of possible transmission.

At least that’ll be how I will implement it. No backend storage and privacy issues to work with.

=== Author: GiantSCR===
Gov.sg have stated that they are not pulling loc. data and they would require your consent to extract the encrypted contact ID if you are a confirmed case. I would not worry about this app except that Bluetooth sucks juice like crazy and there are privacy controls for Apple devices that might limit effectiveness .

Anyway the State has the existing capability of pulling loc. data from Telcos for national security and criminal cases.

=== Author: GiantSCR===
Yes, Apple is renown for protecting privacy. But app developers must highlight limitations as not all apps are covered by these limitations. For all we know Gov.sg might have be allowed to bypass like navigation apps. Good for the developer to clarify.

It seems the app would not be able to identify ""who"" infected ""who"". Rather, the app simply identify ""who"" and ""who"" belongs to the same cluster (thus are at risk or infected). 

And as long as not 100% of the population use it, the few people who don't use it could be the hidden ""link"" that spread the infection.

I agree with you privacy is a major concern for such apps.

&#x200B;

>The Government can already track everyone with your cellphone (every SIM card is registered), and all the cctvs around, this gives them yet another way to track you.

As you already said, the government already has means to track us. Thus this is no  ""increased in privacy loss"" compared to before. To me, this app just seems to be a more efficient (and may be automated) way to make tracing easier.

&#x200B;

>We've already done so well with contact tracing so far, there's no need for something like this.

Perhaps this is in anticipation of greater number of cases that needs to be traced/ monitored now that more people are returning to Singapore from overseas. Current ways of contact tracing would have a upper limit, but having an app would move the upper limit higher.

An analogy is a solving simultaneous equation. With 2 unknowns, it can be solved relatively easily. But if there are more unknowns, the time taken to solve would increase exponentially.

As more people return from overseas or more un-linked local cases are identified in a single time frame, I imagine the complexity of contact tracing increases exponentially. So greater use of technology would enable it to be kept manageable.

When iOS app runs in background mode, the information it can include in its broadcast are limited so any useful identifying information are removed. However, this is based on my understanding a couple of years back like 2015. Maybe things have changed!

i am gonna guess it will detect the bluetooth devices in your radius periodically, and cross reference cross paths and duration of ""meeting"".

I would probably analyze the signal strength if there is the data to see how close the person was.

=== Author: efallenone===
That's true. I guess it can't be helped.

=== Author: thefibrobee===
“Close contact is defined as—

a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period of time; close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case
– or –
b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case (e.g., being coughed on)”

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html

“A close contact is someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes, or been in the same closed space for at least 2 hours, as someone who has tested positive for the COVID-19 when that person was infectious.”

https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/novel-coronavirus-close-contact.aspx

I think being next to someone who is talking for 15 mins or longer, for example on public transport, would also count, since that would expose us to enough saliva droplets from that person.

Transient contact on the other hand, would refer more to people we pass by (who aren’t sneezing or coughing during the encounter), or the persons next to us on our public transport commute who aren’t talking for at least 15mins/sneezing/coughing.

=== Author: CervezaPorFavor===
>Anyone near by can get all your contacts.

This is a bold claim. Source?

If we're just talking about security in general, Wi-Fi also has risks. Even mobile connection itself has risks. The golden rule is to keep your device updated with the latest security updates (easier on Apple and some Android vendors).

Besides, we are fighting a more urgent enemy here.

I just downloaded it; the app explicitly says that for iOS users, the app has to be kept open for it to work. The app’s “home screen” also specifies the following: 

“How you can help stop the spread of COVID-19: 
Keep app open in power saver mode, especially in meetings, public spaces, and public transport.”

I’ll prolly start bringing my iPad mini out with me to use on my commutes so that I can leave the TraceTogether app open. (and also disable auto-lock)

For iOS users have to keep the app in the foreground without closing or putting the device to sleep. iOS no longer permit apps to run in the background for longer than 7 seconds anymore. 

The exception to this is navigation applications and music playback. 

Also apps can barely pull out any device hardware identification now. Things like MAC address or serial no are a no no now.

And at the end of the day, if one has doubts about tech (not that people aren't already Instagramming everything they do, for eg) or the people that run the tech (hi Google and FB) *then don't use it*. We just have to take the cost of imprecise and incomplete contact tracing as a sunk cost. And hopefully not blame the Gahmen when the inevitable occurs.

When the source is release, there is no need to ""reverse engineer"". Opening the source to the public make the code more secure and robust, not less, which makes abusing much more difficult.  Releasing the source does not equate to exposing data (which they claim is stored locally anyway). Claiming open source is less secure and susceptible to abuse is pure FUD with a ostrich mentality.

=== Author: Uranium-Sauce===
App developers have to submit their app (not the plain source code) for Apple’s review before it is approved to be listed on app store. Which means that Apple actually more or less has the capability to scrutinise an app to a certain extent, even without the source code.

If the government were to openly request, it would be extremely bad PR for Apple to turn them down, considering the current situation.

=== Author: moshumaiike===
pneumonia just is when the lung tissue consolidates and becomes more solid. 

viruses and bacteria can both cause this. viruses can also cause infection and damage to other structures in the lung without the lung tissue consolidating. 

so yes covid can cause pneumonia.

and yes it can cause permanent lung damage.

pls feel free to correct my definitions if incorrect

=== Author: dashrandom===
Can confirm. I had a collapsed lung when I had pneumonia as a kid. The damage is permanent in the sense that it won't recover to the state it was before once the illness is gone but it can heal over time. It's like a torn muscle basically. But if you compare yourself to your peers, you may notice a difference in some things as its ""setting you back"" with the damage.

Unpopular opinion, I think we have been very proactive regarding this situation, mostly the authorities, so far what we have been doing is more than enough accordingly to the threat level. 

Let's compare our reaction to America, which according to [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-lags-thailand-and-malaysia-in-pandemic-preparedness-says-economist) was number 1 in pandemic preparedness, we were rank 24, below Spain, France and the United Kingdom. Now look who have the highest number of cases now.

When the virus first started making waves, we started to test all cases of pneumonia in public hospitals regardless of travel history, while doctors in America were begging on the behalf of their patient who had symptoms of COVID-19 to be tested from the CDC only to be rejected because of lack of travel history.

When situation in Italy was rapidly falling, we immediately place travel restrictions and issued stay home notice, while there are numerous reports from journalists who had been to Italy, that weren't check in the airport and self isolation was just a recommendation.

While the Singapore government announced testing and medical treatment will be free for people with COVID-19 (Now locals, PR and pass holders), people in America are expected to pay 150 to 3,000 to be tested. Discouraging them from seeking help.

While state politican have to beg people to stay home, especially when they had to use police resource to force quarantine a man because he don't feel like it. We just charge those who provide false information, conduct regular site checks and deport pass holders who disobey the law.

When the President Trump told the public 15 cases will soon go to zero and by summer, the virus will be wipe out. Our Prime Minister spoke in 3 languages to urge calmness, inform us to expect and prepare when the shit hits the fan.

Singapore has just been very lucky so far. If you have seen some of the cases, the patients have  been bounced by clinics 2-3 times, extending their time before detection by more than 1 week. 1-2 weeks, is all that is needed to blow up to 100 or even 7000 cases. Singapore still cant afford to test anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Even 100 more cases is a very big deal. The lower end of case fatality rate(CFR) is 1%, which mean on average, for every 100 people infected, 1 person will die; whoever that is irresponsible, and caused 100 infection, has pretty much murdered 1 person. Singapore has just been lucky again, so far to have 100 recovered case but no death yet.

COVID is a very deadly pandemic that is just waiting for us to slacken our defence.

Other than the price of testing and treatment, I believe many of the steps Singapore took like early travel restrictions, temperature screening, quarantine/isolation mandate is doable and scalable.

Tigher border control measure I listed won't prevent the outbreak but it will most certainly buy them extra time to prepare and plan.

But I'm not one of those ""I DON'T CARE WHO THE OPPOSITION IS, AS LONG AS I DON'T VOTE FOR PAP!"" folk either.

But I gotta say, this whole thing has been handled extremely well from beginning until now. There is no way we would be able to deal with the severity of the situation this well without YEARS AND YEARS of preparation. This sort of measures cannot be thought up and put in place at the last minute.

So unless my the opposition contesting my GRC has really got its shit together, I'm not taking a chance on them. I don't give a shit about them ranting and raving about how bad the G is to us. I want to know how they've got my back. It also didn't help that the opposition leader who knocked on my door last year to gain my vote was really sarcastic to me. That's not the way to win, my man.

=== Author: bigzij===
I'd get why you think the measures are 'basic' or boring, but seeing as how most other first-world countries failed to handle the crisis as well as our government did, and coupled with the fact that we Singaporeans tend to take things for granted sometimes, I started to question, and I extend the question to you as well, if these measures are really indeed 'basic'.

After some consideration, I would have to say that it isn't 'basic' at all, and in fact, there must have been rigorous planning and considerations before ordering and executing these measures. Economy aside, training the healthcare, making the public aware and educated, collateral geopolitical effects aside, as well as many other factors, coordinating a population size of 7+ million should be hell. 

I've had the pleasure of coordinating low-risk, controlled groups of 100-200+ people before, and our organizing committee's motto was already ""whatever can go wrong, will go wrong"" (and they did), so I must imagine how much harder it is for the government to coordinate a nation with so much more at stake and on such short notice.

I think my comment was misinterpreted. I’m a fan of PAP’s governance. I’ve always voted for them and Vivian, living in bukit Timah.. he’s my guy! 
I do however think Vivian has dropped the ball on a few occasions. I genuinely thought he would be one of the guys in the running for PM  back in 2008/09.. but with the youth olympics and early flooding gaffs he never really recovered politically. 

It’s great to see him doing exactly what he should be doing. Foreign minister and potentially health minister.

Its crazy in USA now. Supermarkets all swiped clean. No more toilet papers. People are turning their attention to Asian supermarkets for their stocks. If food runs out and the situation persists, things could turn dangerous because almost everyone has a gun. It happened during some of the Hurricane crisis where people used guns on each other. Not forgetting looting and raping. The virus is crossing border over to Mexico and there's a possibility that it will mutate there. Mexicans are increasing border control to try their best to keep it out. The young Americans are still hitting the bars and pubs, total disregard for the CDC's warning.

I think Dr Balakrishnan nailed this interview session and showed off the good side of Singapore, but it's definitely different from how LKY would have handled the interview (when he was PM). 

Then again, LKY has a different type of charisma that can't be easily emulated. That said, great job by our ministers handling this issue (on all fronts).

=== Author: raspberrih===
My personal opinion is that even if I have issues with the policies, I do believe the PAP will listen to feedback and amend the policies according to whatever logic they use. Like, they won't blatantly do stuff just for personal/political benefit. But I also understand the anti-PAP POV a little...

Feels like PAP would do well to poach outspoken politicians from other parties and tolerate more dissent within the party.

I believe the culture being sincere in wanting to help those in need cultivated by the Singaporean society matters more than the frequently referenced ""if u give them more money means they wont take more money one la"". You get many examples of poverty stricken countries rife with corruption because of low wages but their counterparts, wealthy officials who, given an acclimatization to an indulgent lifestyle, seek even more money ala the United States, Italy, Korea. Because they are well to do, the corruption present is not as often referenced as those from less well to do countries where there is the very common stereotype of ""its okay la just bribe them so they won't take their frustrations out on you"". They are an example as to how high salaries don't necessitate lower corruption. I know you mention assist but imho the correlation between pay and corruption is not as strong as many Singaporeans may think. I believe there is a definite need to look at addressing the average sandwiched middle-class Singaporean's concerns with income inequality. When the people who society deem as more important than you also earn a much higher wage than you whilst you juggle to keep up with the increasing costs of living yet failing to be afforded most of the financial assistance available, there is a growing general feeling of ""gahmen take all my money"". To me, it's most definitely more complicated than that even though my tldr opinion is ""no gahmen is not taking ALL your money"" but the ok boomers do not develop these feelings overnight over nothing. And while we brush aside their concerns as old people coming up with bullshit to satisfy their mundane lives and answer their unfulfilled dreams and aspirations, the discontent and ill-meaning is growing. People who normally straddle the fence find solace in more extreme beliefs and ideologies. We've seen what that kind of sweeping social epidemic can do to countries like the US and the UK with society so cleanly severed into factions. And sure we are a conservative, generally diam diam country but even our bedrock of social stability will experience the consequences of the more knowledgeable minority taking the dissent of the less knowledgeable majority too lightly. And it's not to say that they are completely 100% wrong either. We know it's not a perfect system but let's not stop at just acknowledging it and telling people to shut the fuck up because it's not that bad ase we're not those unfortunate countries where people are barely surviving. As a first-world society we should strive for the status quo to not be merely to survive but for every single individual that makes up this country to thrive. ""Fucking hell you want 5.6 million people stay in Bungalow??"" No ah but I don't want every single tertiary student to either have to a. be born into wealth, b. apply for laptop scheme for some ass laptop that will crash when you open Powerpoint or c. spend the precious moments of respite after 4 years of life changing eduation in some $7 per hour kena-scam-by-agent part time job to afford a laptop deemed necessary for schoolwork. Seems far away but not impossible. As my old SWO used to say ""eh mai humji la the journey of 24 click begins with one footstep"" to my astonished ""CMT I Pes C9 but ok can"".

Think there is a huge disparate between your understanding and how much logistics, manpower and org is taking place behind the scenes. 

Let me name a few on top of ""just"" contact tracing & isolation. Specialized wards, isolation locations, daily timely updates, message broadcast, contact tracing team, isolation enforcement, budgeting for all affected, border controls, cleaning measures, medical teams protection measures, foreign affairs etc etc 

All these didn't just pop up from nowhere, there's no magic elves that comes out at night and made all these work. 

There's real people working very hard at making sure their responsibility runs smoothly as part of a bigger machinery. There's a lot of planning involving many different parts of the nation and public services.

 Boring for sure, but definitely not 'just' isolation and contact tracing.

What you say is possible. But if w/o SHN, instead of 1 main -> 3 family members -> community and their Sch/workplace -> more, the spread would be 1 main ->family, community and workplace-> more.

Doing SHN slows the spread, and the earlier the main show symptoms, the earlier can prevent the spread and form of cluster

And hopefully knowing you stay with SHN will make the family members to try perform social distancing against others subconsciously.

People can to hospitals and have symptoms and yet are still free to roam around and even able to fly to sg to seek treatment. Then people still think it's a good idea to go there now? I really hope we don't become like Italy where we see many dying cos the hospitals are overloaded. People need to do their parts and take precautions too. One less person infected means one more hospital bed for those who needs it.

It's easier said than done. If you start coughing in a foreign country, do you immediately assume you have covid, book a new flight back on the same night and go straight to sgh? No that's crazy.

Remember that for weeks many people in the US couldn't get tested for the virus because they had to meet the ridiculously limited testing guidelines, and there were cases of doctors who had to argue to get their patients tested. And even if you could get tested, only a few labs in all of the US were able to process the test kits, so one could wait days to find out the results. Also, they charged people  US$3,270 for getting tested, and are generally known to have bankrupted people without insurance through their overpriced treatments. Oh, and lots of their test kits were faulty for some reason, which greatly delayed everything.

It sucks that he waited 10 days to get treated, and we can only speculate why he didn't fly to Singapore sooner, but I can certainly see why he wouldn't want to seek medical help in the US.

i lived in america for three years (2015-2017) and can confirm.

Hasn't changed. The state I live in has a population that's close to Singapore's. They've tested less than 200 people, and their testing has a hit rate of ~20%, which means they're really only still testing cases that are very high risk and no-one really knows how bad the community spread is at all.

=== Author: theblahking11===
Has this happened to New Zealand, India ? They have close the borders. Economy doesnt need people to travel - it only needs goods to travel which will travel no matter what.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
I do agree that he should have been more proactive in getting treatment given that we're in a pandemic. Even now, we still have people insisting that it's been blown out of proportion and we're all being stupid and fretting over nothing. 

I remember during the early days of the outbreak, lots of people speculated that only Asians were affected by the virus, and the media in other countries kept saying they had nothing to worry about for the virus (""Flu is worse! Flu and H1N1 killed more people!""). The US was also massively under testing for weeks, so he might not have realised that he had it.

=== Author: nonametrans===
They have different economies? The strength of Singapore's dollar partially comes from the confidence the market has. If confidence tanks, so does the value of SGD. Locking down the nation does not scream confidence. No confidence in the SG market = less trading within businesses/companies in SG. Less trading = less income for the govt. Less income = lower GDP and further decline in confidence in SG markets.  
See this video for more info: [https://youtu.be/aKuNk5ZRzLg](https://youtu.be/aKuNk5ZRzLg)  


India and NZ has massive exports (e.g. agricultural, tourism, etc) which brings in foreign cash for them to trade with, so they're not as affected. What does Singapore have? We're just the middleman for everything. Oil refining? Middleman. Business/banking facilities? Middleman. Shipping? Still the middleman for cargo transshipment. When other countries find a better, more suitable middleman, we are goners.

=== Author: wiltedpop===
Obviously we are middleman country. But if we get hit like Italy and probably just one mega cluster away it also doesnt help our middleman status.

Here are several reasons why locking down is not an effective measure. See the link. Social distancing is. Lockdowns are effective for controlling panic in a population.

=== Author: SteaksBacon===
The GE has deadline one, I think latest by April? Don't know yet if holding it early or pushing it as late as possible is better. If the virus doesn't go away and stays for a whole year like what many scientists predict then later is not always better.

Imagine holding it with 500 infected vs holding it with 1500 infected. The threat from the people to people contact rises the later it goes unless the virus is contained totally. It doesn't like it can be contained with it already wrecking havoc globally though. Imported cases is rising. Unless we have vaccine by GE la, but is it realistic to vaccinate everyone by GE deadline? Probably not.

Vote by upvotes. Rally by AMA.

=== Author: youcanraedtihs===
Copied and pasted my reply from another discussion. The mentioned video in my comment below has been posted by another redditor.

---

Nobody is debating on the usefulness of electronic voting, but the main gripe with it is its suitability. If you have watched the video that I've posted in my comment, you would have already understood what I'm about to say.

First things first, electronic voting, especially using SingPass, breaks the most important requirement of every election: Anonymity.

No doubt SingPass is a convenient platform for all transactions with the government, but accountability is built into every nook and cranny of that system. That means your hardware identifier (serial numbers, MAC addresses of PCs/phones/routers), IP addresses or SingPass ID (NRICs, mobile numbers?, email addresses?) will be recorded by the system. These are needed for logging, security and recovery purposes.

Next, another crucial requirement: Trust. Can the electronic voting system trust that Tan Ah Gow is not using Lee Ah Mao's credentials to vote? Can the system trust that Lee Ah Mao's voting device is not maliciously compromised? Can the system trust Lee Ah Mao's vote is not altered or leaked along its route from voter to counter?

Can people without the technical know-how and details confidently trust the voting system's

* Confidentiality - votes are accessible only by the voting system and not kept or accessed by any intermediaries (e.g. Telcos, GovTech, IMDA) in its route
* Integrity - tick for Party A remains a tick, at least until the vote is counted  
* Availability - system will not be down, either by issues of its own or by hackers. And in the event of any outages, Confidentiality and Integrity remains.

Can campaigners from Political Party White and Political Party Blue trust that the electronic voting system does what it says it does and they can clearly witness its actions? Just like how they can witness the sealing and unsealing of ballot boxes?

Most importantly, can technology-illiterate Ah Gong  independently cast an e-vote without guidance, or access to an Internet-connected device?

Even if you may fully trust the electronic voting system, [human](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-than-1500-singpass-accounts-could-have-been-accessed-illegitimately-ida) is [always](https://www.asiaone.com/digital/man-hacked-and-sold-singpass-data-china-gang) the [weakest link](https://www.businessinsider.sg/a-former-presidential-candidate-was-locked-out-of-his-singpass-account-after-he-posted-personal-details-online-and-now-wants-better-security-measures-implemented) in computer security.

Fundamentally, the aspects of an election are simply a mismatch with that of electronic security.

It also stressed that the Leave of Absence Support Programme - which was extended to businesses and self-employed persons affected by the stay-home notice requirements - is not applicable for those who have travelled after Mar 15.

""For avoidance of doubt, the LOA/SHN Support Programme for employers and self-employed persons will not be applicable for travel (work-related or non-work related) that commenced after Mar 15, 2020,"" it said.

""In other words, employers and self-employed persons will be eligible for the S$100 daily support when affected workers serve out mandatory SHN requirements if their travel out of Singapore commenced on or before Mar 15, 2020.""

=== Author: chocopinkie===
hmm. but thats so weird. with more people probably will get SHN/LOA, they suddenly cancel the support scheme

=== Author: NotSiaoOn===
Not weird at all. The thinking seems to be that if you knowingly decide to travel after 15 March, it's on you already. And if it's for work related travel then it's on the employer, who should bear the cost.

They probably expect 1000s daily to get SHN. It will add up to quite a lot for government to pay out.

So much so, that in Singapore I've been seeing two sides of the coin on a daily basis. I've seen people who rush at the earliest indication of a worsening situation to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries and provisions. I've seen people sharing every bit of information they can access about the pandemic to their families and friends, regardless of its accuracy or credibility. I've seen people also sharing posts and videos, that not only contain no factual information, but that are designed to fear monger those who watch it. 

However, I've also seen large gatherings of students in public places after school. I've seen people who are sick, and travel on public transport without a face mask. I've overheard people talking about other countries, and how their situation is markedly worse than Singapore's ""as their country doesn't manage these things well"" or ""because their government doesn't know how to handle"". 

Both what Dr. Balakrishnan and PM Lee said during their CNBC interview and National Address, respectively, should resonate strongly with us as a nation. 

As Singaporean citizens, PRs, or residents, we are extremely fortunate that our government, healthcare services, and workers who are dealing with the pandemic, have been able to guide us in handling the COVID-19 situation in the best way possible. 

Whilst we are currently being held in high regard for our country's management of this outbreak since it began at the tail-end of 2019, we cannot let this be a reason for us to become complacent. We have been able to effectively approach COVID-19 due not only to our infrastructure, but also to our actions as individuals. 

Our government's advisory has lead us on the best path so far to combating the severity of this pandemic, and whilst we should be confident in their abilities to guide us going forward, we must always remember that each of us contributes to combating this virus effectively. It is up to us to play our part and work together with each other to continue Singapore's effective management of COVID-19.

Whatever demographic you may be, take care of your personal hygiene, and be respectful of it to those around you. Practice social distancing, even if you are young and are feeling well, because even if you carry COVID-19 but do not show any symptoms, by going out to public common spaces, you could transmit to someone who is much more susceptible to the virus than you are. Always check news sources to ensure information is factual and correct. Do not share media if it does not come from a credible source.

We have been able to set an example to the world on how to combat this virus, so let us all continue to work together to keep ourselves safe, well informed, and prepared for whatever may come by taking a rational and sensible approach to new information as it becomes available to us.

Nope, nope, and nope. I am not sure about the tone you are implying (it comes across to me as rather edgy), but we are not Americans, nor are we much like them.

Our country is like that, because all of us are here - the country does not make the citizens, the citizens make the country.

A difference in culture, perhaps, in how we view our countries.

You can go ""I love Singapore"", we most probably will go ""uh... ok"". Not that we do not love our country,  we simply do not celebrate, nor hype it up as much.

An opinion:

We take a look overseas, and we see how you can basically sway millions of people into your opinion, into doing your bidding, by simply quoting their country, and/or a religious text, for extra, extra, extra added effect. 

I would like to believe that we do not subscribe to that here, because we understand the consequences of that not just from the West, but from the North, South and East of our island as well.

We are educated to think more critically, for our survival, and that involves being sceptical of our government, and understanding these questions: ""Can we evidently, sure as hell, do a better job than them? Do we have the time, money and resources to do a better job than them? What will happen, in terms of consequences, if we were to take charge of everything, and run everything the way we wanted to?"".

The answer, is generally a no, and for the last question, we understand, that the country, in its intricacies, is more complex than viewing people by who you vote for, and what colour you are. We run a country, not a popularity contest. It involves changing the lives of others as well, which, unfortunately, a lot of countries make light of.

Where Americans sometimes call themselves the greatest country in the world, Singapore is always about the little red dot. Every singaporean is aware that we're small, we have a small population and there are giants all around us. Our politicians speak incredibly carefully to not step on the toes of giants everywhere. Center of the world is a definite no. In fact I suspect we sometimes have a mild case of insecurity.

Patriotism is just normal I guess. We're proud of our country but we don't really feel the need to flaunt it. Our giant neighbors are usually very ready to respond with sarcasm.

Singapore flags are prominent only about a month or two a year, around the time of our national(independence) day. Beyond that we rarely see it out in public.

how CSJ a leader? he has never won a single election. The jury is out for TCB. He did many stupid things since starting an opposition party. That in itself is a vain thing.

CCS appears irrelevant next to LW. It is increasingly obvious that HSK isn't fit to be the next PM. LW seems a far better choice.

But you’re not just voting them to get through this covid crisis. You’re giving them a mandate for the next five years.

PAP received a mandate in 2015 and look at what happened. We got the reserved presidential election and POFMA, not to mention the barrage of attacks on the WP. All because of the feel good SG50 and LKY’s death.

Try to remember why you hated PAP before covid19, then consider whether you want them to continue down that path. Don’t base your vote on covid alone.

Healthcare workers’ role is to heal the sick. You still need leaders to come up with policies such as travel restrictions and economic packages.

Sure PAP have done some things that we find questionable but the question is if you elect opposition, can they do a better or the very least, similar job than PAP. The answer to me as of now is a straight no. 

Then you might say I wouldn't know until I gave them a chance. But to me I would want to see a certain level of caliber from these opposition before I want to take the risk of letting opposition run for the next four years. Until now the caliber is not there yet so the risk of me choosing them to run the country and failing is very huge for me , much greater than the possible chance of them succeeding in their job if they were to be elected.  

Four years is a long time and much can happen in those four years, so for now I sincerely hope Singaporeans can vote logically and not because they want an opposition for the sake of having an opposition.

Even the WP don't intend to form the government. Their goal is simply to have more seats in parliament (a third I believe) so that things like the changes to the presidency and POFMA actually require a proper debate and convincing in order to be passed.

It will always be no because they never had the chance. Its like the whole fucking chicken and egg/ fresh grad and job shit.

Which came first, chicken or egg.

To get a job need experience, to get experience need a job.

I am pretty apathetic to politics but one day I hope opposition get majority so they can fuck everything up and then people stop saying PAP is shit tier. And even if they don't fuck everything up and do the opposite of making everything fucking glorious then you know what? The country still prospers so who really gives a shit.

You're not choosing opposition to ""run the country"", you're mainly electing them to act as a check to the PAP when it comes to introducing new legislation. We will always need alternative voices in parliament to counteract the echo chamber that brought in the presidential ~~s~~election and POFMA.

It's _very unlikely_ for the PAP to not achieve the majority in the upcoming election, and not be able to form the government (executive).

Agreed. Many think that those voting for the opposition aim to get the opposition into power (ie, to become the ruling party). Not sure why so many people have this fallacious and illogical misconception. Opposition voters may not even support the ideologies of opposition parties; for many, the purpose of voting for the opposition is to Ensure a check and balance so that the PAP does not have unfettered discretion to do whatever it wants or cock up whenever it wants.

For most gyms, they might actually be cleaner than say holding the metal bar in the MRT. Gyms are cleaned daily, most of the time more than once a day. 

Observer all the same personal hygiene steps you would else where. Don't touch your face etc, and I don't think you are that much worse off than the average population

I'm on Classpass and they've announced after WHO declared a pandemic that they will be rolling over all the credits. I have received one or two emails from yoga studios informing us that they are closing, but there are also studios encouraging people to join (cos + immunity, which I personally think is a bit irresponsible cos you're in an enclosed space with sweaty people). 

I've changed to working out at home and outside and have stopped going to the gym, but I understand people might have signed up for packages. Stay safe!

=== Author: zalesa===
Gyms are actually one of the cleanest places around if the management is good. There are always cleaners around at my gym even before covid disinfecting and wiping down equipment several times a day.

>My studio has reduced capacity, but I'm still cautious about going. Yet I'm still paying a hefty subscription despite not going. 

It's perfectly normal to not want to go to gyms or studios at this time; have you asked if they could provide a complimentary extension or freeze of your membership at this time? A few gyms that I know of provide fee waivers for those doing 14-day SHC if they just got back from overseas. 

Certain gym managements are kind and understanding enough to assist this way

=== Author: septeal===
like all places/things, just need to watch the basics, hand hygiene, avoid touching your faces.

for gyms, probably good to have 2 towels, 1 for laying on the equipment, 1 for your face, and sanitize your hands before using the towel for your face

challenging and tedious steps but just some ways to mitigate the risks

=== Author: caipo88===
But being in an enclosed room full of sweaty people huffing and puffing? I hope I don't come across as being combative but I think we can exercise outdoors too where it's probably safer.

Traffic towards outside of Singapore has been extremely bad. If you connect to services which has servers based in Singapore, such as YouTube or Netflix, they are less affected.

Once you go outside of Singapore, such as Reddit, Imgur, or discord, the quality goes to shit. AFAIK, the ISPs aren't doing anything about it.

Lube is lube, Sanitiser is sanitiser, they are both mostly liquid but they do not perform the same function.

More importantly, some sanitisers may contain ingredients that could result in less than desirable outcomes depending on where you apply them.

Lube is also far less effective at making your hands sanitary, they do however make it easier to escape if someone is intent on putting you in a deathgrip.

H1N1 didn’t bother Singapore as much. But SARS though. It was serious. Serious enough for a board game to be created to spread awareness. I think Singapore (and us Singaporeans) are more experienced and cautious after the SARS.

=== Author: None===
I just graduated from uni back then and most of my peers were more worried about getting/keeping a job in the recession and life proceeded as normal. I actually dont remember anything about it until lee hsien loong mentioned it back in early feb 2020

=== Author: sherbro===
Not H1N1, but i think most folks would think of “PCK say don’t play play” when they think of any sort of coronavirus. Not a bad way to get the message stuck in your head, tbh.

But seriously, our govt in 2020 is doing a fucking amazing job now compared to both SARS and H1N1. People were even more kancheong and scared back then because it had never happened before, so the reaction was bad. Temperature taking was a daily occurrence for awhile. Everyone who lived through that knows what a “quarantine” is without googling. If we had this type of contact tracing and public messaging back then, the experience would probably have been very different.

However, internet was not so much of a thing during SARS so I don’t recall as much hysteria being spread. 

Going through two epidemics means a more experienced (but not jaded) society who is able to KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON.

I can say though that the Europe and US  reaction now really reminds me more of post-9/11. Not steady, not using their blain.

=== Author: Expat111===
I'm an American who was in Singapore for both Sars a d H1N1. Sars was dark and scary. I remember staying at home for 2-3 weeks and rarely going out. The streets, restaurants, bars and everything were empty or closed. H1N1 though was more business as usual. Lots of temperature scanning equipment that made a heat map of your face, hand washing, masks, but more normal times.

Today, in the US with Coronavirus? I can only describe it in one word, PANIC! I've never seen a people so scared and irrational. Everything is sold out at the grocery stores a d our gun shops are empty too as everyone arms up for something. It's bonkers!

=== Author: LightBluely===
I was in Primary School back then and as far as i remember, we have to take tempreture regularly. 

Also, it was the start of limited vistors from going to hospital. They gave you the visitor card thingy in order to enter since there was no tapping IC in or out at the time.

=== Author: LatelyUnlikely===
I remembered H1N1 or SARS people never hoard or wipe out supermarkets.

=== Author: byechemistry===
Was in primary school and I actually was tested positive for it. Life went on pretty normal to be honest and I had to stay home for 14 days. Need take temperature every morning though. Didn't hear much about hoarding of stuff tho.

=== Author: BR123456===
H1N1 was nothing much. My exchange to China got cancelled by the school but everything else pretty much went on as per normal, maybe there were temperature checks everyday - I don’t remember. 

SARS on the other hand though, was something else altogether. I was too young to really remember it, but I remember the schools closing for a while. Looking at the situation now, it’s a rough gauge of just how badly Singapore got hit at the time to resort to school closures. Not super accurate though as Singapore got to learn from the experience and become more prepared for it this time around to not have to resort to those measures yet. I do remember my parents had a lot of trouble having to juggle going to work (since telecommute wasn’t a thing) & having to care for their kids during the day. There’s a lot of great heroic stories that came out of it, and I remember having annual elearning exercises in school ever since to prepare for the possibility. 

If anything, having some past experience has helped the current government response immensely. If you see which countries seem to be doing relatively ok in the current pandemic, you’d realise they’re usually countries that got smacked hard by SARS. H1N1 was probably a testing ground for whether the measures are effective - probably a reason for why it didn’t balloon up as much because it got shut down pretty quickly.

rowgw,"COVID-19: Stay-home notices for all travellers entering Singapore from ASEAN countries, Japan, UK, Switzerland",289,fiz4i9,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-singapore-malaysia-asean-stay-home-notice-12539952,315,1584295326.0,,2020-03-16 02:02:06,"
=== Author: risingsuncoc===
In addition to the stay-home notice requirement, all short-term visitors who are nationals of any ASEAN country will have to submit requisite information on their health to the Singapore Overseas Mission in the country they are a resident of before their intended date of travel. 

The submission will have to be approved by Singapore’s MOH before travel, and the approval will be verified by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the Singapore checkpoints.  

“Short-term visitors who arrive in Singapore without the necessary approval will be denied entry into Singapore. They are therefore advised to secure the approval before making definitive travel bookings,” MOH said.

Pretty soon UK will be promoted to quarantined list, judging from their plan to stop testing and let 60% of population get infected.

""60% of UK population need to become infected so country can build 'herd immunity'"", according to UK's chief scientific adviser.

=== Author: nova9001===
UK is definitely a must to quarantine. Their government's stance is just let life go on as normal, there is no containment strategy.

=== Author: oofmewho===
Toughest measure so far wow

=== Author: unsynchedcheese===
I strongly suspect the reason the US is not included is because the countries outside ASEAN that are on the list are the ones which had publicly announced that they are not bothering with containment (or giving up entirely).

Meanwhile, the US has not publicly announced such a thing, because their messaging from the government is so incoherent that nobody actually know what their plan is.

Hence the article going ""this is a dynamic situation"", which is presumably diplomat-speak for ""we dunno wtf is going on there"".

Is this backdated? i.e, for someone who returned from those countries within last 14 days?

The wording is ambiguously misleading.

"" From 16 March 2020, 2359 hours, all  travellers (including Singapore Residents, Long Term Pass holders, and  short-term visitors) entering Singapore with recent travel history to  ASEAN countries\[2\], Japan, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN). ""

So the ""16 March 2020, 2359 hours"" refers to:

(A) the time from which travellers from these countries enter Singapore, or

(B) the time from which the 14-days SHN starts?

Could really be either.

Does it include transiting through KL?

=== Author: MadLadOGuchi===
Sorry to ask, but did the minister mistake Switzerland with Sweden? I know it's a ridiculous ask but I hope to shed light on a few things and get a confirmation.

On 13 March 2020, the Federal Council decided to cancel classes in all educational establishments until the 4th April 2020, and has banned all events (public or private) involving more than a hundred people. It has also decided to partially close its borders and enacted border controls. The canton of Vaud took more drastic measures, prohibiting all public and private gatherings with more than 50 people, and closing its educational establishments until the 30th April.


While Sweden on the other hand has decided to go with the UK method and only control at risk and elderly while letting younger ones get the infection.
They have ceased all testing, have not shut down the schools or events smaller than 500. They have not enacted border control - to be fair, they never had one to enact. 
They tested up to 800, the day before it was around 400 and suddenly decided to stop which seem suspicious to me. 

Both Denmark and Norway have decided to shut down schools and border, but Sweden has not (severe lack of funds and resources).


Even china spoke up against Sweden about their poor policies, although somewhat politically motivated, they wouldn't have a ground to stand on if they weren't doing so poorly.


So, I am sorry to ask, but is it possible there has been some misunderstanding and confusion here? 
I don't mean to insult anyone, but I am bit lost here and confused myself over how this happened.

All guidance talks of SHN for a full 14 days, there is no mention if rules alow you to depart before 14 days.

We fly from indonesia, one night stay at hotel, then flight the following evening to London.
We really have to go to the hotel because we left luggage with them while we travelled Indonesia for a month.  Otherwise we would rebook flights and simply transit.

The UK govt is absolutely underperforming at this point and I don’t know why. 

If UK gets promoted to this list by SG, then my cousin might not be able to fly back at all.

I mean for clarity sake, the PM said he wants the virus to go on and hopefully with enough ppl infected and recovered, there will be herd immunity which prevents further and future spread.

If they can’t refund you even with this new shn advisory. 

Instead of moving it to another flight, tell them to make it an open date ticket. You will have a 1 year window from the date of ticket issuance to rebook flights to anywhere using its value. No additional charges when you rebook, just need to retain your original ticket no. and you can top up if the new flight is more expensive. 

All the best!

No. But do take note of your own health and self LOA if necessary.

Edit: they will issue you SHN if you cross immigration after 16th March 2359. If you cross immigration before that, everything goes as normal. After that date and time, you will join a separate queue and get issued a SHN while you are clearing immigration. All this is assuming you have no symptoms, no fever, no respiratory illness, and didn’t get called up for swab test after leaving the plane. 

100% confirmed + chop.

Edit 2: Okay, 95% confirmed + chop, the 5% is I don’t know if you will join a separate queue to get issued the SHN or you will be issued SHN in the normal queue. I did see a long line for people that landed from Shanghai, and I assumed they were getting their SHN delivered to them while clearing immigration.

ASEAN countries probably due to proximity, thus the higher rate of international travel.

The other 3 countries (actually 2 were explained, Japan, not really the case) were explained in the article

> Instead, some of the countries under travel restrictions have ""abandoned any attempt"" at containing the spread of the virus, he said.

> Noting that the UK and Switzerland had said so ""publicly"", Mr Wong said: ""If there is no deliberate effort to contain, then we anticipate that the numbers of infected cases in these countries will rise even more sharply in the coming days or weeks.""

> However, the US has ""put in place quite stringent border control measures"" for travellers from Europe and is also starting to ""ramp up"" some of their measures, including testing, the minister said.

> ""We are watching America and like I said, this is a dynamic situation; every few days we have more information about the status in different countries,"" Mr Wong said. 

Also, if US wasn't on the list due to blatant politics, China wouldn't have been on the list as well.

=== Author: musr===
Overall still good measures. Just bought their F35. Later Trump throw tantrum at threaten to cancel. Many countries are understanding and don't criticise Singapore unnecessarily when we're protecting our citizens. But Trump is not what one can say is a mature individual.

Switzerland currently has a steadily increasing number of cases even after it has hit the 2000 mark. The Singapore government issuing Stay at Home Notice for people coming back from Switzerland does NOT mean that Switzerland is not doing a good job at handling the outbreak, it’s just a preventative measure considering we have had one case recently who just came back from Switzerland and Germany (not sure which country of the two he got infected in, though. That would be impossible for us to trace.) Another example is South Korea is on our travel ban list even though they are handling the virus situation very well at the moment. The sheer number of cases they have still poses a risk, however successfully they have contained the virus at present. The government is having to reassess the travel ban situation everyday because things are changing rapidly across the globe. Sweden and USA and a few other countries will definitely be on our quarantine list soon if things get much worse, which I predict they will be. Please don’t take it personally as we are just trying our best to protect our citizens, as are the Swiss I’m sure, and there is no “best solution” to handle this outbreak at the moment.

=== Author: tehtf===
I think it is just a measure for high risk countries. Just checked and currently Switzerland and Japan have 2.2k and 0.8k cases. They are given the restriction of 14 day Stay home notice, but at least traveling or transit through singapore is still allowed

=== Author: tehtf===
On the other hand, 2 weeks ago Singapore was in the top of the confirm case list with ~100 cases, and we already do LOA/SHN to South Korea/japan. But now looking at the charts, I think MOH can basically tear the travel advisory and just issue one statement “don’t go anywhere”

=== Author: MadLadOGuchi===
Which I find strange.

Denmark and Norway have decided to limit their borders.
Sweden has decided to do nothing and not even report new numbers since hitting 800. 

I would suggest avoiding Europe for a while because I don't see them cleaning and disinfecting things as I hear from my Singaporean colleagues your country is doing. 

If a country is problem with crime and bombings, they will have no chance against a disease.

According to the Ministry of Health's website, you won't be subject to the 14 day quarantine if you don't leave the transit area in the airport.

=== Author: Mmscstar===
As you exit the airport there is immigration clearance. At the immigration hall there is a sign stating that if you have entered from certain places or been to certain places recently you are to inform a desk. Upon checking they will issue you a SHN.

If you are not exiting the transit area then the issue of SHN will not arise.

However, if you have been to certain other countries you will not be allowed to transit through Singapore.

I'm deliberately not enumerating the countries as this list is dynamic and growing. Please check the latest info

Herd immunity strategy is insane. Truckloads of vulnerable people are gonna die. Hope SG doesnt get any ideas from this.

Edit: Read the FT on this. UK means to build herd immunity in the healthy population over the LT, so they can wont see a relapse like other countries when draconian measures are removed. In the ST, UK is implementing social distancing esp of the elderly, quarantining of entire families. Like SG, they haven't suspended schools or shut down shops and restaurants.

=== Author: yoshkoshdosh===
They are basing it on mathematical assumptions that are moving targets. The fact that they still ban large gatherings, sports etc shows its controlled. They want the NHS to be able to cope with the increased rate of serious cases.

The letter did not ask to reconsider does it? Just to encourage social distancing and share the assumptions data.

You know, most of he European countries have decided to go the UK route, right? It's not just UK.

The UK is the only one talking about it, the other ones try to hide that fact.

However it becomes apparaent once you realized they haven't shut down schools in the face of exponentially growing cases but instead decided to stop testing all together to report low numbers. They have also no border control and no problem letting patrons go to pubs and clubbing.

Especially with a virus with known cases of re-infection after recovery.

=== Author: Boogie_p0p===
I think it's precisely because NHS is broken, that's why they're doing this. If they take in all infected, NHS will drown.

=== Author: MadLadOGuchi===
The issue with that theory is, that you don't actually get immunity against it long term. What happens next winter?

You need to flatten the curve, introduce measures to increase social distancing and start limiting gatherings now so you can get the numbers lower.

=== Author: mantism===
they're probably banking on it being a treatable disease (which is true) so they're expecting to just hold back the tide and just keep treating people. Eventually, everyone will recover from it and be immune.

Of course, it's a very contagious disease so I doubt the UK's ability to treat everyone at one go.

Not just healthcare. Here in IL. State government blew a fuse at the condition in O'Hare. Nobody in federal gov thought that having this ban will cause massive influx as people rush to come back. More screening no additional manpower. 

Letting the Orange speak is also counterproductive even to their agenda of preventing panic and restoring confidence to the market, short statement everything also wrong. How to calm people when the white house statements need fucking footnotes and errata.

Testing only seriously ill means our numbers are at best behind in time at worse totally different from actual number.

There is no federal level plan at all. Both sides and their media lackeys still want to score points more than doing anything to solve the problem.

That is a ridiculous false equivalence.

If the aim is to stop the number of imported cases, it seems to be sensible to go after people who seem to have contracted it in the US -- which seem to pop up daily now (including today) -- rather than just the countries that supposedly might start exporting cases in the future.

This seems to have multiple aims: stop countries with repeated imported cases here and punish countries they feel aren't doing enough to stop the virus. Seems they're punishing countries, like Vietnam, that aren't guilty of either, and letting off a country, the US, that is guilty of one, and arguably both. It's bizarre.

As far as I know, very few countries (mostly South Pacific island nations) have put in restrictions like these that call out the US specifically.

I think u/MadLadOGuchi was alluding to the fact that in the press conference, Min Lawrence Wong said that some countries including UK, Switzerland and Japan have given up on containment.  


>""It's not just about the numbers, but the fact that these countries have abandoned any attempt at containing the spread the virus ... especially the UK and Switzerland,"" Singapore's National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday (Mar 15) explained the need for new border control measures to guard against COVID-19

SOURCE:  [COVID-19: Singapore concerned as some countries have given up on containment, says minister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxAuMEo5XTs)

=== Author: MadLadOGuchi===
No not at all, I trust your country more than I trust any other country! 

That being said, one issue here is you would be punishing Switzerland for being honest while Sweden is being deceitful by stopping testing and going the UK route without admitting it. 

They haven't updated any numbers sine they hit the 800~ mark. Assuming exponential growth, it should be around 2000 now, not to mention they have't shut their borders, schools or any of their pubs. 

No active measures and an indication going the UK route. 

That was my question really, why Switzerland is on the list while actively taking measures and Sweden gets a pass. 

I meant no offence btw.

=== Author: MadLadOGuchi===
But you must understand that certain countries who have given up will always report low numbers? 

Switzerland is reporting numbers and cases using active tracing just like Singapore is doing, while Sweden has decided to put a lid on it and haven't reported since hitting 800 mark. That was almost a week ago, by now that has probably exploded given no measures are taking to shut borders and schools.

>Additionally, there are many unknowns in how the SARS-CoV-2 virus  interacts with the human immune system and how this might play into  current scenarios. For example, we don’t yet know if this novel virus  will induce long-term immunity in those affected as other related  viruses do not. ***Therefore, it would be prudent to prevent infection in  the first place.*** More research is urgently needed on this front. 

They then asked the government to start implementing social distancing and to share data so that they have enough time to understand the virus and develop the medicine for it. They're asking the government to try to prevent the spread rather than let 60-80% of their population get infected.

The thing is, if they're going with this strategy instead of containment, they're playing a dangerous game, because all it takes is a couple of clusters to blow up and they'll still drown. Attempting to contain IS part of the delaying strategy, the less clusters you have the less chance you have of something blowing up.

Nope, not a law. It is case by case basis. You have no case if you purposely choose to travel to affected region after government has already issued travel advisories.

If you are in Japan before the govt issue travel advisory, the practice is HR will NOT deduct from your annual leave. 

If you are not in Japan when the govt issue the travel advisory on 15 Mar and you still went ahead with your travelling on 16 Mar, then HR will deduct from ur annual leave.

Anyway from MOM WEBSITE

If that is not feasible, employers can consider the following options, or a combination of the options, for the employees on LOA/SHN:

Treat employees’ LOA/SHN as paid hospitalisation leave or paid outpatient sick leave;

Allow employees to apply for annual leave;

Allow employees to use advanced paid leave or apply for no pay leave, for employees who have used up their leave entitlements; or

Other mutually agreed arrangements between the employers and employees / unions.

Is not agree or disagree, is accessing how risky a British is being infected with virus to let him into Singapore, given the British gov direction.

If you think about it, Singapore is actually taking similar approach minus the contact tracing part (5 days MC if you sick, hopefully self recovered after that, if not go GP again get another 5 days or go for testing, flattening the inpatient curve). 

LSL already mentioned such approach of stopping contact tracing, priotizing healthcare resources to the serious ill and letting mild symptoms to self quarantined and self recover at home a possibility if situation worsen and out of control during his first speech in Feb.

... maybe SG put the words in clearer and rational way that the public are able to understand and take it down.

=== Author: kcinkcinlim===
From what I've read there were about 100 cases in China where patients who recovered were re-infected again.

Not common but certainly can't rule it out. Also gives the ""herd immunity"" suggestion less weight.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
South Korea and Japan have also seen reinfected cases, but there's been some debate as to whether they're really reinfected, or if the virus just somehow hid and gave a false negative result, and that they were never recovered in the first place. We'll have to wait and see whether we'll see any reinfections in Singapore, because that would help to answer those questions.

=== Author: bonkers05===
I just don't understand why they are given up on containment so quickly. Is their surveillance and contact tracing capabilities so bad that they have decided that they cannot do that and have to go for the higher risk strategy?

=== Author: calicotrinket===
Not wrong though is he? He's being realistic. 

The point is flattening the curve so that the peak remains in a state where the healthcare system can cope. Italy and Wuhan are cases in which the healthcare system cannot cope with the number of cases and are now drowning.

The UK is not likely to do contact tracing anymore - 800+ cases are there already. Singapore is advantageous that there aren't too many local transmissions going on. 

Their approach is basically what LHL has said, to ban mass gatherings (now in place in Scotland), major events etc. You can see how they're controlling the cases - in the past it's contacting 111 if you are sick and suspect yourself to have the coronavirus, the approach has changed now to self-isolate 7 days if you have fever and cough, and to contact 111 only if you feel you can't cope or if the fever does not subside. No doubt some people will die from this, hence Boris' speech preparing families that they may lose loved ones.

=== Author: KampongFish===
Those cases have been ruled by medical experts to simply be cases that had slipped past the radar, aka rushed/shoddily tested due to the immense amount of patients China had to handle.

There is no real evidence to suggest that reinfection is an immediate worry. The cases and rates of ""reinfection"" are much too low to reach any definite conclusion.

Are you PR/Long term work pass? Principle of this  land/sea exclusion: there are too many Malaysians commute daily to and fro JB/SG for SG work. It will be castatraphy if there is sudden banning with out pre-emp and plans for the impacted.

If you insist on going, current 2nd worse case scenario is you will be hit by 14 day SHN if you return to SG from desaru. Worse case bring you became confirm case

=== Author: aurorashell===
Ah so you didn’t call them specifically about this sudden advisory from MOH?

=== Author: luminarae1===
Think CNA took it direct from the MOH website. From 16th March onwards, if you’ve arrived here from the any country in the last 14 days, you probably will be served with a SHN. Think it’s just a day’s notice so people can get affairs in order with their companies. But like the comment below says, we’ll all find out tomorrow anyway.

=== Author: evilplushie===

SHN is issued at immigration. They need your particulars and contact details and a valid address of stay.

=== Author: kopipeng===
Yup if you plan on not getting served SHN. They havent ironed out the details for sea and land crossings from Malaysia so the situation might change anytime.

You can also fly to senai airport in jb then bus back from there.

=== Author: aurorashell===
Yes but it appears they will only enforce it at the border from 16 March 2359 onwards. Hence people already in Singapore (who travelled today) will not be subject to being served the SHN at the airport and hence no need to serve the 14 day notice

I think will take longer. Any drastic measure will really hurt SG and JB economy and livehood. Those that are in the discussion are mainly work permit and PRs who travel back and forth daily.

=== Author: smalldog257===
You're probably right that it will take longer than a day for a joint SG-MY group to come up with anything. (Maybe by next year?) But SG will unilaterally make sure to check everyone's travel history.  I expect they will close the automatic gates and redeploy ICA officers from Changi to open more manned counters at Woodlands and Tuas.  Anyone who entered Malaysia other than by land or sea from SG should be given a SHN.

=== Author: tehtf===
Yah they can do that through airport.
Other measures I can think (or already done) is —1.temperature sensor checks and deny entry for high fever 

2. Hostel/hotel accomdation for them at subsidized rate ( since expect lots of spare room with the tourism plunge)

If they exclude Malaysia, a lot of businesses will close down, especually those industrial operations in Tuas, Jurong, Woodlands, and Sembawan, most of all, the semiconductor factories in Singapore, which are heavily reliant on Malaysian workers. Of all of the exports Singapore has, semiconductors are one of the highest value - and also the one industry that can't shut down except in extreme situations like wartime

However, at the same time, banning air travel from Malaysia probably will just inconvenience Malaysians that would fly home (say to KL or Penang) once or twice a month (I have several colleagues that will surely continue to go home, but instead of flying now, will just take a bus - one has their grandparents taking care of their baby in Penang)

it’s our social responsibility as a country to ensure if you’re a high risk of spreading the disease, you shouldn’t be working and are staying at home. but if you are pressured into working because you need the money to survive, in my view that is not the fault of the worker but the company that allows it to happen.

edit: virus, not disease.

He touches the outside of the bag/box. Which the recipient than touches when getting the food out. Very few people would wash hands between touching the outer packaging and starting to eat,

Then it's the packaging he touched, not the food. Contact is really brief anyway and you have to be pretty unlucky to get infected that way. If I recall correctly, only about 20% of close contact get infected, and these close contact doesn't include transient meeting like this.

Flew right over my head haha.

=== Author: 5k1u30zp===
The contact with the packaging depends on where he got the food from. Sometimes riders need to walk a particularly long distance to and from the shop to their vehicle. He already has onset symptoms, so he could very well be touching his face while walking with the plastic bag for several minutes.

Anyway a small but non zero probability. The number of customers served for the week probably means there's a good chance someone else got it.

=== Author: Calikura===
Not too convinced. Remember the local study showing that infected people extensively contaminate their surroundings? So it's not just about the hands touching the food packaging transiently. Should the infected rider be shedding the virus, the rider's clothes, motorbike seat and handlebars, phone etc would be heavily contaminated. And when hands go from these surfaces onto food packaging, the contamination is more likely to be transferred.

=== Author: DuePomegranate===
I have a PhD and am a working scientist. Grab delivery guy wearing motorcycle helmet -> virus accumulates on inside of visor from his breath -> virus on his hands when taking off helmet (or he just rubs his face or coughs into his hand) -> virus transfers to the handles of the plastic bag of your food -> you grab the handles -> you touch the cutlery or rub your eyes or eat with your hands.

I’m not saying that Grab guys are going to spread it to every customer, but it’s not a very low risk transient contact either. 

Do you think that this virus is only spread by inhaling someone’s cough? Then why is there so much emphasis on hand washing, and not touching your face? Indirect contact is a very important means of respiratory virus transmission.

=== Author: throwaway96655===
How much to pay then? Take note that their working hours are irregular, their incomes are not regular as well. What is the maximum number of sick leaves that they can take?

=== Author: RuthlessLeonidas===
Randomly mentioning you have a PHD without stating your field of expertise and ""hurdur I'm a scientist"" doesn't automatically make your comment a fact on the internet. Prove it or shut it boomer. Also the fact that all kinds of scientist coming out to explain that it's not how the virus works just makes your comment even dumber. All you do is read articles on /r/covid19, calm the fuck down with your LARPing

=== Author: pokkamilkcoffee===
there are many ways to alleviate this problem. one way is before they can even do that they have to ensure that grab employees are considered employees, and not independent contractors. this ensures labour protection. then ensure a basic minimum wage for all its employees. 

i understand grab will never do this because it hurts their profits. which is why i blame them and not the worker. they have the ability to influence social responsibility. but they won’t. profits over people.

=== Author: throwaway96655===
That is literally the business model of grab ( or Uber or go gek). They merely link up the customers and the riders. In other words, they are the facilitators.  If the rider wants a regular income with mandatory sick leaves and paid leave, grab is not the right company. Perhaps in climate activism, the people who will be affected can have a say.  In this case, Grab/Deliveroo are not running a charity and neither should we be entitled to expect otherwise 

Tell me which business don’t earn profit?

=== Author: subtracker167===
No those are not “ways”. The shared liabilities are reduced for maximum profit (*for the deliverer as well*). To employ all deliverers and cover their liability, profit for the worker will drop, which is not what the profit driven deliverer wants. 

I understand the deliverer will never do this because it hurts their profits. Which is why the driver should’ve been a responsible person and not expect others to cover for his irresponsibility. But he won’t. Profits over people.

=== Author: pokkamilkcoffee===
i know it’s their business model. i know businesses only care about profit. i’m saying this is bad. which it is. 

so when people point out in this post that the worker is being irresponsible, i’m saying that’s not the case. it’s businesses like grab that is being irresponsible.

=== Author: pokkamilkcoffee===
your argument would be valid if the workers and the CEO/shareholders of grab have an equal share of the profits. which they don’t.

=== Author: rthreeohone===
? Name me a company where an employee has an equal stake in profits as the CEOs/shareholders... the entire concept of shareholders is fundamentally different than that of an employee..

=== Author: pokkamilkcoffee===
no no i’m not saying that’s what i want. i’m just replying to the argument the other commenter made that the worker cares more about their profits over people too. but it’s a silly argument to make considering the profit share is very skewed. 

a company that is much better at addressing this issue, however, is the [Mondragon Corporation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) in spain where workers have much more influence in the decision making of the company and therefore, a larger stake in it. 

i know it’s not a singaporean company but it’s very interesting to see a company adopt a much more democratic system and be very successful.

> # Pofma office orders opposition politician Lim Tean, 2 Facebook users to correct posts alleging PA event led to S'pore's largest coronavirus cluster

> SINGAPORE - Three Facebook users, including opposition politician and lawyer Lim Tean, have been issued correction directions by the Government for alleging that the People's Association (PA) and residents' committees (RCs) were involved in the organisation of an event that has emerged as Singapore's largest coronavirus cluster.

> The Protection from Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) office said in a statement on Wednesday (March 18) that the deputy chairman of PA, Mr Chan Chun Sing, has initiated the latest correction order on posts about the Feb 15 Safra Jurong Chinese New Year function that has so far surfaced 47 cases of confirmed Covid-19 infections here.

> All three - Mr Lim, ""Henryace Ace"" and Mr Sebastian Ying - posted or shared links saying the PA and RCs were responsible for the infections linked to the event.

> Mr Lim, who is the People's Voice party chief, did so on both his pages Lim Tean and Tean Lim.

> According to the government fact-checking website Factually, the posts alleging PA or RC involvement in the organisation of the Feb 15 event are ""entirely false"".

> It said: ""PA and the RCs were not involved in the organisation of the dinner event... and were not in a position to cancel it. PA and the RCs also did not fund or publicise the dinner event.

> ""The event was a private dinner function organised by a singing instructor for members of her singing groups.""

> This is the third time Mr Lim has been issued with an order from the Pofma office, with the first time being in December last year for a post which the Government said had implied that it was spending more on foreign students than Singaporean students.

> He was also instructed to put up a correction note in January after sharing an article by website AB-TC City News that claimed five Singaporeans had contracted the coronavirus without going to China.

> Related Story Fake news law: Opposition politician Lim Tean told to correct Facebook posts alleging Govt spends more on foreign than local students

> Related Story Coronavirus: Government debunks fake news on closure of Woodlands MRT station

> All three will need to put up a correction alongside the offending Facebook posts.

> This is not the first time the law has been invoked to correct statements made about the Covid-19 outbreak.

> In January, two Facebook accounts were issued correction directions after they made posts claiming that Woodlands MRT station was closed for disinfection because of a suspected Covid-19 case.

> SPH Magazines was also asked in January to correct an online post in the HardwareZone forum that falsely claimed a man in Singapore had died from the virus infection, while The States Times Review Facebook page in the same month was instructed to correct a post that claimed Singapore had run out of face masks.

> Pofma, which gives ministers the power to act against a piece of falsehood on the Internet when it is in the public interest to do so, was passed by Parliament in May 2019 and took effect on Oct 2.

Yes I think even Korea has noticed an increase in the number of recoveries compared to infections too.

But IMO China didn’t just make a simple mistake. They deliberately covered up the situation till other countries started to notice and didn’t even do anything when they found out about the virus. Literally even let Wuhan citizens travel a few hours before the lockdown. Which they also only gave a 24h notice for if I rmb. And lastly, when shit hit the fan in wuhan, instead of helping the local government in handling the situation. They decided to throw all the blame at them and essentially stopped communicating with them

So that you aren’t confused I’ll ask again. Where would you prefer to ride it out?

=== Author: vanillakopi===
Quality of life is linked to the economy

Social divide has remained a stagnant problem since GCT era. While more can be done the government has made steps to address it see 2014 SSO offices 

Kindness and graciousness is something that singaporeans tend to lack but are you demanding that the government force people to be kind? While this is impossible it has done the next best thing by partnering many charities, encouraging enterprises that look out for the less fortunate etc 

Concern over the environment has already been addressed so idk go read the news?

Basic virtues?????? Care to elaborate

=== Author: Kazozo===
Quality of life is not linked to the economy. It only is, as I stated if your basis for living is based on making money. Many poorer countries are actually happier countries.

All the negative traits we have developed, selfishness, hoarding, kiasuism, neighborly kindness, apathy, is a result of trickle down economics, with a mentality again geared towards profits above all else. 

Singapore has changed in the last decades from a carbon sink to one of the highest carbon polluter per ratio countries in the world. That is again a fact. 

Anyone can insist that government is doing this and that. Well, of course they must have tried or be trying something, duh. But it's the results which count. Other than being wealthy, have we degraded in other aspects due to government policy, the facts speak for itself.

>Quality of life is not linked to the economy. It only is, as I stated if your basis for living is based on making money. Many poorer countries are actually happier countries.

Quality of life is dependant on many factors of which economic factors do play a role. While we do face higher levels of stress etc I'm sure with the majority having jobs 3 meals and a roof over our heads our quality of life is indeed higher than these poor countries you talk about. I think what you meant to say is the happiness index which is a fair point.

>All the negative traits we have developed, selfishness, hoarding, kiasuism, neighborly kindness, apathy, is a result of trickle down economics, with a mentality again geared towards profits above all else. 

This is just LOL it's pretty clear that you have a deep seated resentment against the government
End of the day the government is not perfect but that does no mean you discount everything it does and blame it for everything else. Are you telling me if an alternative party takes over magically we would not be like this? 


>Singapore has changed in the last decades from a carbon sink to one of the highest carbon polluter per ratio countries in the world. That is again a fact. 

That is a consequence of industrialisation. If you trace the process between all countries, there is a steep increase before it gradually decreases. Right now we are at the stage where we should (and we intend to) start decreasing our output. If you want to debate whether we should do it sooner it's fine but dont go distorting the facts to claim the government doesn't care about the environment.

=== Author: Happyygirl===
Such a big country with only 4 deaths?

They are doing a tremendous job compared to China, Italy, Korea, Japan etc...

=== Author: ExGranDiose===
No point arguing with that dense guy. He doesn't understand and he bring whataboutism into this argument.

=== Author: Kazozo===
You are right I have used quality of life and happiness interchangeable. Ultimately isn't happiness the end goal, and materialism need not be the only means to that end. 

Certainly a new political party may not magically change social norms. But different sets of policies which focuses on developing social values rather than almost completely on profits from the onset will certainly have a high level of success. 

Similarly for environmental concern. If the government only bothered about it late, it translates to the same that there is little concern about it. There's no choice now, and what we can do is likely damage mitigation at best. 

What is there to debate really if you continue to insist that government cannot do any better and wealth is all that matters. Or it's possible I have seen things which you have not being wrapped up in a personal bubble. If it's an issue, then it's an issue. We don't need to treat the  government like a baby in cuddly clothes.

=== Author: ExGranDiose===
LOL you are truly delusional by measuring deaths as a effort of success when it should have been the opposite. 5th death already confirmed by TheJakartaPost, Indonesia has a lack of testing kits and hospital facilities can only tank so long before collapsing like Italy, remember when Italy had a few deaths and now over 600++. Indonesia is at that risk too.

Also, you provided close to 0 evidence of why Indonesia is the safest SEA country to be in.

Let's not forget than the confirmed cases are also not a true measure of the severity of the situation. There are cases out there and more will bite the dust. That includes Singapore as well.

Go travel the world a bit, maybe you’ll realize how good you have it here. Literally nobody is saying wealth is the only thing that matters. But it is incredibly important, even in so called “woke” countries, the economy is inevitably the number one concern of the vast majority of people. There’s a balance to be struck and the electorate decides what balance it wishes to strike. We have a government that is excellent at judging where that balance lies, that’s why it continues to enjoy a mandate, a very strong mandate in fact.

Indonesia is much closer to the corona and has done a much better job stopping it from entering their borders than Italy and Iran. You just refuse to give credit due to your bias don't you?

You only recognize a good job when the virus has already blown through a city and slowed down?

Zero evidence? Their infection and death rate is much much lower than other developed countries. They deserve huge appreciation.

Since you hate Indonesia what about India? Their death and infection rate is amazing compared to other developed nations.

That I do agree, but with so many people choosing to travel overseas due to cheap flight tickets, it really sucks to see so many others placed at risk, especially the elderly.

Thats why my point is to target the source by cutting out idiots who still want to travel during this time, who don't want to have to pay for extra medical bills in the chance that they get infected. And since there is a quarantine like what another redditor said, we will still reduce the chances of community spread while reducing the root causes.

So the imported cases have been to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, United States, United Kingdom, Philippines and Germany... Sounds like a global pandemic indeed...

=== Author: quietobserver1===
So this increase in imported cases is bc they started swabbing everyone arriving at the airport, right?

=== Author: musr===
Of the 9 imported cases of the 12 new cases, most are local, work pass holders or long term pass visitor. Seems like only 1 is short term visitor. That's not too bad.

Looks like imported cases might keep forming the majority of daily new cases, which is a good sign that our local community transmission rate is lower than many parts of the world.

I just hope our hospitals don't get overwhelmed during this pandemic.

If we manage to stay safe throughout, we may even be able to send must needed test kits to places in the world that desperately need it.

Isn’t it weird that we have so many cases from Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines? Their community spread must be quite high.

=== Author: 557088===
Not everyone, only those with symptoms.

=== Author: bidet803===
I'm slightly worried that the local populace might not be monitored as rigorously as incoming travellers from 'danger' sites, though, since the latter have to self-quarantine and get followed up on. Whereas if a local with no travel history or link to existing clusters presents with mild symptoms at the doctor's, chances are they'd probably be told to just rest at home (hence why so many people doctor-hop I imagine, to get the diagnosis they're suspecting). 

Most cases will be mild ones but it's the transmission rate that concerns me, especially since we're not testing on a scale similar to S. Korea. And that seems to have bred some complacency. I've seen all-too-many people coughing into the air or running around without a face mask in spite of having visible symptoms. Queued in front of someone who wouldn't keep their distance despite constantly sniffling and clearing their throat the other day, and it made my skin crawl a little.

I get not wanting to overwhelm our limited medical resources though. Just hope the govt's calibrated approach works and everyone gets out of this okay.

I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these imported cases besides the obvious Indonesia/Malaysia ones are coming to Singapore deliberately to get tested instead of getting tested at whichever country they were at because they know that our healthcare system is good. The new cases are coming from countries like USA and UK, which are still undertesting and hoping that other countries will pick up their slack and do the testing for them. I saw this news article the other day of this Vietnamese lady who had to fly back to Vietnam from the UK to get tested because the UK refused to test her for the coronavirus. She was already having pneumonia symptoms and lung damage by the time she arrived to Vietnam.

Hey, not sure if you know this, but if you’re a public lister company, you can apply to SGX and ACRA for an extension of time to hold your AGM by 30 June 2020 instead.

It will be automatically granted as long as your company’s FYE is 31 Dec 2019, subject to meeting certain specified conditions (e.g. still releasing your AR by 15 April 2020).

This will give you time to make alternative arrangements rather than rushing to meet the 30 April 2020 deadline to hold your AGM.

throwaway100895,Are Singaporeans in general too complacent about COVID-19? Why do people still insist on travelling to affected areas for holidays?,68,fi8b1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fi8b1m/are_singaporeans_in_general_too_complacent_about/,84,1584167961.0,"The Singapore government has handled the COVID-19 situation very well, and things seem to be under control. And because of this, many fellow Singaporeans downplay the seriousness of the virus and become complacent. The situation in the EU is becoming more dire by the day, along with the virus spreading like wildfire throughout the US. With such heck-care mindsets, I predict that the imported cases will balloon out of proportion with community spread very soon.

I am currently in Stockholm, Sweden. I live outside the city with 3 other Singaporean housemates, 2 of which don't seem to take this virus seriously, wearing masks seem to be a bullet-proof option to them, when the right way to protect ourselves should be to practice social distancing and halting any non-essential travel.

One of them has their whole extended family coming over for a holiday tomorrow and they will be touring the city, visiting attractions and whatnot. With the situation in Stockholm becoming more and more dire by the day, and the local government basically halting tests for non-hospital cases, the numbers seem artificially low. It's a matter of time Sweden follows in the footsteps of the other EU countries, it's just a **matter of time**.

Knowing this, the family still chose to come and will be visiting my lodging. I mentioned that I wasn't comfortable with having a whole group of people who walked around the whole of Stockholm visiting the lodging but was shut down with ""Oh i'm sure they will be taking the necessary precautions like wearing masks and washing hands"".

Why do people still insist on endangering themselves by participating in non-essential activities during such a dangerous period? As if it's not enough to endanger yourself, you choose to endanger the lives of others as well. Avoiding any crowded area/social distancing should be the best prevention method at this point, not wearing masks and washing hands religiously while touring the whole infected city.

AITA for calling them out for their selfish actions, or am I just blowing this out of proportion?

One reason could be financial ""loss"" if they were to cancel their trip. Nobody really wants to fork out thousands of dollars of bookings for nothing. 

Stockholm is a nice city, but I found towns like Vadstena, Kalmar, Orebro and Oland a lot more satisfying. The Gota Canal is mesmerising. If there are less infections outside Stockholm then it might be a better option for your housemate to spend less time away from the city instead.

Genuine question: since you mentioned that the family members are coming over **tomorrow**, I assume that this trip was planned months in advance. I doubt that when the trip was planned, this was such a huge deal then (which it is apparent now). So what would you have liked the family to do in this case?

As there's no travel advisory that I know of for Sweden, they can't cancel their flights and get a full refund. Will you be reimbursing their financial losses? 

Asking your roommate not to travel/meet with his family is entirely unreasonable as well, since I can safely assume a large reason they're visiting Stockholm is because your roommate is in the city.

I do agree health is more important than wealth, but both sides are selfish in this case.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
You're not blowing this out of proportion. This is very serious and people need to start taking this seriously, or the virus will spread exponentially and the curve will never flatten.

Start sharing articles about the horror stories that the Italian and French doctors have been saying about the virus, that they're seeing people as young as 20 being in serious condition and needing oxygen to breath, or that someone assesses the patients everyday to decide who they have to let die because they're out of beds and have too many sick people waiting to get treated. Tell them that some people who survived the virus end up with lung damage that could be permanent. Tell them that the Italian hospitals are already overrun, that France and Germany are only days behind them, and the rest of Europe will join in. When hospitals are overrun, many will die due to lack of beds and oxygen tanks, and they may be among the people turned away by the hospitals if they fall ill. The UK is already prioritizing their tests and medical care for the elderly and those with co-morbidities, and everyone else is just asked to self-isolate for two weeks, even if they have a fever.

Do everything in your power to get them to understand, or try to move somewhere else so you'll be away from them if they insist on going ahead with their trip.

Probably gonna receive a lot of flak here but tbh my opinion is that people are seriously over-reacting.

The virus has an extremely low fatality rate and it's obviously not going to go away anytime soon due to its contagiousness. You cannot seriously expect humanity as a whole to care too much when statistically the chance of catching/dying from it is so low. Generally people have a ""won't happen to me la"" mentality and I feel we should deal with situations pragmatically.

My opinion is that the economic damage if everyone stopped travelling and stopped going out so often far outweighs the human cost.

I do agree however, that people should take reasonable care to not spread it. Maybe treat it like how you would treat the common cold, practice hygiene etcetc. 

Just my worthless 2 cents, feel free to poke holes in my stance. Maybe I'm wrong and that people falling sick causes more economic damage.

Let’s say that the family has used up quite a portion of their savings to pay for this once in a lifetime trip, is it fair for them to forgo the amount paid for the trip if they’re not that well to do? 

They are not the ones to be fully blamed if they have tried asking for a refund but failed to get it from the insurance companies, airlines or hotels/accommodation. 

I read that many have found it difficult to get refunds from countries that their govt has yet to issue any travel advisories. Therefore, I feel that it is unfair to fully blame them to just forgo their hard earned money since many companies are not doing their part as well to stop the virus from spreading.

It's not just the low fatality rate. It's also the world's leaders, the WHO and the media that downplayed the seriousness of the virus at the beginning of the outbreak. So many of them kept repeating ""The flu is way worse than the wuhan virus! So many people die per year to the flu"", etc, even though the flu has a lower R0 (spreads less easily), and has the lower death rate of the two. It was a very effective campaign that worked too well, so of course most weren't going to take it seriously.

You are right, the virus has a pretty “Low” fatality rate. The scary thing is how contagious it is. This virus has the ability to engulf and overwhelm whole healthcare systems, that’s the problem. 

Look at Italy now, their healthcare system is failing. Doctors and Nurses are infected. They have to make decisions on who to **let go** as in not treat them because they have a Low chance of survival. 

I don’t get your stance, you’re suggesting everyone to stop giving a fuck and just go about their lives normally, spreading the virus everywhere and crippling all healthcare systems? How will that help the economy in the Long run? Everyone will be down with the virus, nothing will be open anyway.

Thanks for the unneeded insult and shade. 

The EU countries have chosen to take different measures, some choosing to close schools, some choosing to limit gatherings of more than X people. 

But there’s one thing in common for all of them, the containment phase has failed and they’re now in the slowing down phase. The UK has basically given up and are telling people that they want the population to ride it out. Sweden has implemented a ban on gatherings of >500 people but have not added any additional measures. People returning from badly affected areas are **not required to quarantine** by law and are only told to do so if they feel unwell. Several of these countries have chosen to stop testing for non-hospital cases, and this will create a false sense of security for their people, and travellers looking to come here.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that things will continue to get worse and worse. It might or might not reach Italy’s stage, but Italy started out exactly like that.

Take vitamin C, D and zinc to boost your immune system, and if you have a fan/s, use it/them to ventilate the room/s as much as possible so that the virus dissipates. Keep the toilet clean and ventilated, and keep the lid down when flushing. Tell your roommates to keep the lid down and show them this article.

Yes, but most people act on fear, not rationality...

Just like how people fear traveling on aeroplane more than car, even when traffic accidents happens far more frequently. Because the thought of falling thru the sky is scarier

Why is this getting downvoted? It's true.

Apart from the downplay of seriousness, Singaporeans are just too comfortable in their little ""safezone"" because of proper handling techniques by the government. And a lot of Singaporeans don't bother to read up on current affairs in other countries.   


You already have people going to church and dinner gatherings, creating more clusters, precisely because they don't treat it seriously. Complacency kills.

=== Author: daosaopao===
You're right, it's an overall shitty situation, no lie. But don't you feel that their healthcare system is failing partially due to their government's own shortcomings? The silver lining could be that governments all around the world realize how under-prepared they are against viruses and they have measures put in place in the future against similar threats.

I'm not saying we should not give a fuck, I'm saying that if collectively, we do the basics such as practicing proper hygiene, sneeze inside your elbows, wash hands frequently, we would reduce the risk enough.

Of course if I got the virus because someone had spread it to me, I would be pissed. But if that person had practiced the basics, and if it's just down to shitty luck, what can I say right? That's just life.

I don't mean to attack you in any way in my next sentence but you're studying abroad, I'd reckon your family is pretty well off. Well off enough for you to have medical care should you desperately need it.

I don't think it's fair to look at Italy and panic the same way we shouldn't look at Singapore/Hong Kong and go ""yeh it's all good"". I feel the truth is somewhere inbetween. We should just all practice the basic standards and stay home if we do not feel well. Large scale events should be reduced to slow the spread but in terms of individuals just shopping or visiting places, I don't think it should be a high level concern y'know?

I lived in singapore for 15 years and just moved back to the US. 

I’ve found the federal government’s response to the situation irresponsible, nonchalant and dangerous. 

I see my countrymen responding with a Panicked complacency (if you can have such a thing?)

Hoarding from stores but generally no one is taking it seriously.  I find the general disposition is one of “oh it’s just this years thing...it’ll blow over too.” And the leadership from Washington is kind of “meh” also. 

I’m frustrated and venting.

=== Author: meractus===
You are right. We should be first trying to avoid social contact, then if that's not possible, wear masks and wash hands.

=== Author: throwaway100895===
They’d still be spreading it on the plane back, if they caught it here.

Or their family and close friends. 

But ironically this family will be infecting their own, and also their friends this time. Only then they’ll see the seriousness of the matter (hopefully).

That’s what I’ve been saying. There’s a good chance of them catching the virus and bringing it back to my house, and possibly even back to SG while infecting people on the plane. 

My housemate went to pick them up yesterday morning, went out with them the whole day and stayed over. They’re all now back at my house and apparently will be cooking dinner for us later. Nice gesture but I can’t stomach it tbh

=== Author: throwaway100895===
You feel that the “basics” of washing hands, sneezing into elbows are enough to stem the spread of this virus, because in Singapore it’s largely contained (and hopefully will stay that way). 

Just try, try to put yourself in the shoes of the people living in more badly affected areas. Knowing that you have an increasing number of official cases reported every day, and highly likely there’s an even larger number of affected people who are not tested, and thus not represented in the official tally. 

In the EU countries, I can safely say that your “basics” won’t do anything to stem or reduce the likelihood of spreading/contracting the virus. 

If you’ve been keeping track of cases in Singapore, you’d realise that the safety net is not 100%. We have more and more imported cases, and it will continue to rise as the virus spreads all over the world. The government has already stated that its impossible to isolate Singapore from the rest of the world, so be prepared for more of such cases. Drop the ball, get complacent and there goes all the hard work the government has been doing to trace all contacts for the past few months. All it takes is one person who doesn’t treat the virus seriously. One.

=== Author: throwaway100895===
I'm so sorry to hear. It starts out like this everywhere, people downplay the seriousness of the virus, fail to take it seriously. And when it finally hits them, they don't know how to react appropriately, until things get to Italy-level bad. 

I'm just hoping Singaporeans don't get too comfortable and complacent, because things will continue to get worse. More imported cases will arrive, and there's a high chance of community spread from these cases. One slip and there goes all the hard work.

=== Author: daosaopao===
There has to be a balance that's all I'm saying. Of course if you were in an area that has extremely high DENSITY(not number) of infections, I would think that your room mate and their family is being extremely irresponsible these areas should rightfully be locked down/barred from entry.

However, you cannot seriously expect the entire world to stop travelling and box themselves in for a month over something that has a 2-5% fatality rate. The economical damage that would bring about far surpasses the human cost. More people around the world die to things that are far more trivial (although this is possibly just the start of something massive as well but then again, it's a 2-5% rate).

All I'm saying is that the situation has probably already hit the point of no return. All we can do is to try and slow the spread by being personally responsible by practicing basic hygiene. 

A lot of countries that have huge problems with infections is honestly just down to an incompetent governance in regards to viral outbreaks. Had governments around the world taken harsher and wider measures from the start, the problem wouldn't have gotten this far. But here we are.

Stockholm has a way higher *official* tally than Singapore in an area almost 4 times smaller than Singapore. And note that I’m saying *official* tally, because they stopped testing for non-hospital cases 2 days ago. 

It doesn’t take a genius to realise that the real number of infected is way higher.

=== Author: daosaopao===
Singapore has nearly twice the population density of Stockholm. 

While not ideal to travel there now, I feel it doesn't warrant such a strong reaction from you. End of the day, the situation in Stockholm/Sweden isn't critical enough for one to cancel their trip there IMHO.

=== Author: daosaopao===
At the end of the day, the situation you're in is definitely not ideal. But nothing you do if going to change the fact that they are coming over. Just gotta do what's within your power to minimize your open personal risk is all in saying. Reacting harshly or thumbing your nose at them would not do any good. Just deal with the situation as it is. No point having people on the internet back you up and say you're right when it in fact, changes nothing. That's just what I've been trying to say. Be pragmatic.

=== Author: throwaway100895===
Hell look at Italy, it has a population density of  201.3/km2, compared to Singapore at  7,804/km2. Population density alone tells you nothing. What matters are the responses by the respective governments to contain the spread. Singapore has such a low number of infected because of aggressive measures. None of which are implemented in Sweden.   


So far the guidelines of the Swedish government are as follows: 

\- No testing for mild cases, only for severe hospital related cases (This reduces the official tally)

\- *Please* stay at home if you have symptoms 

\- If you are returning from badly affected areas, there's no need to self-quarantine unless you are feeling unwell

\- Banning of gatherings of >500 people

You should have the foresight to see that these measures are as good as waiting it out, allowing everyone to get infected and build herd immunity. You can set a reminder in two weeks and I guarantee you Sweden will become like Italy. Spain, Germany and France are already on their way. 

People who decide to cancel their trips based on current criticality will be in for a rude shock because in the EU, everything is just a matter of time now.

Yes this is kinda what I've been saying, everyone kinda knows it's already hit the point of no return. Most governments are just gonna wait it out and let the situation stabilize and try to tend to those who are going to need it most. What you have to remember is that the recovery rate is also extremely high this the government is just going to try to keep the status quo to not totally destroy their economy by kick starting a recession. People that recover from it are naturally going to build a defence for it. 

The government has already done their own cost benefit analysis and decided that fuck there's really jack shit they can do about it. They are just basically trying to slow to spread a little so their infastructurr can keep up. 

End of the day I don't know man. Maybe 6 months from now when I look back at this post I'm gonna think I'm an idiot for thinking this way or maybe I'll be right and this is just a short term crunch.

>everyone kinda knows it's already hit the point of no return. 

Really..? But you were saying

>the situation in Stockholm/Sweden isn't critical enough for one to cancel their trip there IMHO 

And you gotta be shitting me, recovery rate is high, if you have enough medical facilities to treat everyone like Singapore (So far). I'm gonna use Italy as an example again because eventually all EU countries will end up like that. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\_coronavirus\_pandemic\_in\_Italy#Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Italy#Statistics) 

17660 *confirmed* cases, 250 deaths = 7.168% mortality rate

Sweden = 10m population, low estimate of 70% of the population catching the virus, and the healthcare system is overwhelmed = **500k people dead in Sweden alone.** Sure, it's only 5% of the population so it must be fine right?

=== Author: daosaopao===
You can hit the point of no return and still not be in ""critical condition"" my dude. 

I don't know man I don't think the statistics are that simple. It's going to be a slow climb to that supposed 70% figure of yours. I'm pretty damn sure it's not gonna be 500k people dead lmao. Seems like fear mongering to me. From what I've read, the virus is most likely going to be on your hands rather than in the air therefore basic hygiene and preventive measures like washing your hands should work well enough. 

Let's revisit this in a month and see how things go.

=== Author: throwaway100895===
> You can hit the point of no return and still not be in ""critical condition"" my dude. 

We can keep discussing about the terminologies, but neither of us are experts. Beats me why anyone with common sense would find it alright to visit a location that hit the point of no return and is heading towards a critical condition. If you have such high thresholds for risks, do it, but don't endanger others.

Yeah you're right. I'm really nowhere knowledgeable to form any real opinion that carries any weight. In times of crisis like this it's always better if everyone acts more like you tbh, to be cautious. Probably wouldn't have nearly as many cases. 

We just have different opinions on how things are currently but honestly I'd lean more towards your idea if we were able to control everyone.

Yes it's definitely important to take measures to flatten the curve, I'm not saying we should do nothing. Thunderf00t did a pretty good video about explaining things imo, showing how it's actually super difficult to chart how bad things are going to be. Video is a month old but I feel the theory is still sound. Which is why I'm saying as long as people take basic, sensible precautions, it could be enough in the long run.

This is a response to this article by the Jakarta Post  [Indonesia slams Singapore for withholding information on nationals treated for COVID-19](https://www.thejakartapost.com/seasia/2020/03/13/indonesia-slams-singapore-for-withholding-information-on-nationals-treated-for-covid-19.html) which was posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fhvgmr/indonesia_slams_singapore_for_withholding/).  Only Jakarta Post released this news story

This is what the MOH, and this is what the Indonesian Ministry of Health said in the CNA article

>Singapore has promptly shared information with Indonesia through the official IHR channel on all the confirmed COVID-19 cases involving Indonesians, to facilitate contact tracing in Indonesia,” said MOH

Indonesian Ministry of Health

>The Indonesian IHR National Focal Point, an official from the Indonesian Health Ministry, has acknowledged receipt of all the correspondences on these cases sent by Singapore’s IHR National Focal Point, added the ministry. 

As someone who is familiar with the Jakarta Post, take their news with a grain of salt. I am pretty sure they mistranslated the Indonesian spokesman's comment regarding Singapore. And I question this quote.

>The Singaporean Embassy in Jakarta told *The Jakarta Post* on Friday that the Singaporean Health Ministry had “a patient confidentiality and privacy policy.

Was it made up by the Jakarta Post, or was the Singaporean Embassy speaking without thinking  At this moment in many countries non-health officials (even health officials) make statements that misinformed.. But I am more likely to believe the Jakarta Post is making stuff up.

I don't think for one minute the Singaporean Government, especially a Ministry like the Ministry of Health would act in such a petty manner and violate an international treaty.

The motto of the Jakarta Post is ""Always Bold, Always Independent"",  You can see from this statement, their objective isn't objectivity, so even by Indonesian standards their reporting standards are low.  Its target market is expats in Jakarta, many of whom don't read Indonesian. They play to this expat crowd.. Unfortunately, Its the primary source of many non-Indonesian speaking foreign reporters.

I am not saying don't trust all the article that Jakarta Post publishes However, Singapore has their own reporters in Indonesia, who can understand Indonesian, and they get news that is relevant to Singaporeans.  Why would anyone here trust the Jakarta Post rather than the Strait Times or CNA?",2020-03-14 12:52:38,"
=== Author: avocado_law===
whats more likely to happen is they get the news from one official who dont know they already got the patient info from sg. prob due to some delay in info sharing, or likely bcos how chaotic and uncoordinated the indo govment is. and being indo officials, its in their dna to shift responsibilities, point finger, and make any sensational statement.

also doesnt help that, like u said, indo media is clickbait factory that like to quote (not misquote!) part of the statements out of context

=== Author: tehtf===
If assume everyone are telling truth and all not wrong in this case:

Then the likely scenario is SG MOH reported to WHO, assuming INDO MOH can get the info in organistation themselves. INDO MOH tried to get the info through other means (direct calls maybe) to the “wrong party” that either don’t know or don’t have authority to get and disclose the information. (Like in company Organisation where you suddenly heard and want to know more about a new procedure and want more info. Person-in-charge: “I already uploaded the whole policy document on intranet/SharePoint. You can go self-service yourself”)

When SG Embassy being asked this question by Indo MOH/jarkata post, they don’t have the info because SG MOH didn’t disclose patient information to them (sg embassy), which seems correct cos in what right should sg embassy know about an Indo patient confidential details?

=== Author: redwithin===
Seems to be an issue internal to Indonesia but the blame is placed on Singapore.

Sounds we went through the right channels, but the breakdown was within Indonesia. When the people who need the info go look for Singapore directly, Singapore isn't authorised to release the info directly to them.

Could either be incompetence or just doing it looking for someone else to blame. Its very much in our own self interest to ensure Indonesia has access to the information.

But you and I know our MOH and MFA, always will be doing the right thing. So if Indon have internal breakdown in comms, that's their problem, but of course SG is always the convenient scapegoat.

Actually heard from from someone in the Indonesian MoFA, Indonesian embassies in SG have trouble accessing information to infected Indonesian’s nationals due to patient’s confidentiality or something. 

This probably just a continuation of that. I don’t know if there’s miscommunication in the lower levels or what. I also have no updates on it too.

=== Author: -LifeOnHardMode-===
It could be a communication breakdown between the authorities. CNA did not clarify that the Singapore embassy in Jakarta had not told The Jakarta Post this: 

>The Singaporean Embassy in Jakarta told The Jakarta Post on Friday that the Singaporean Health Ministry had “a patient confidentiality and privacy policy.”

>However, it added that  “there are no restrictions for COVID-19 patients from Indonesia or other countries from contacting their embassies. It is up to them to decide whether they want to do so. The Singapore government’s first priority is the well-being of the patients.” 

=== Author: annadpk===
The reason why I wrote the post, is people actually believe the Jakarta Post article, that the Singaporean Embassy would say the MOH would withhold information from the Indonesian government., 

This type of information doesn't go through the embassy, and the embassy should know that. Its not a question of whether its in Singapore's best interest, Singapore just has to follow its treaty obligations.  It goes through the WHO than to the respective Ministries.

As for incompetence, the only reason why Singapore is doing well is because of the SAR experience. In fact the only countries that are doing well are countries with previous SARs experience (outside China) Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada.. All the other countries, including Indonesia, aren't doing a good job.

And you believe mothership who had taken the report from Jakarta Post, who only knew about it from NHK. The man in the article had most likely contracted the virus in Japan, before going to Indonesia.   At that stage in time, the number of cases in Japan were small. Who's fault is it?

They traced all the contact and no one had it in Bali at least according to them at the time. You can, like the Jakarta Post, not believe them. 

The Jakarta Post is constantly questioning the government. Calling in experts. For example, they say the Indonesian government is wasting its time by building an isolation ward in an island that used to house Vietnamese refugees in the 1980s. Why would you think the Indonesian government wants to do that? They fear in a normal hospital people will run away like this case.

CMIIW but usually communication goes through the MoFA not directly from MoH to MoH.

There’s a system but I am not aware what kind of informations are given and what informations are needed. Indonesia is huge, and we handle the cases by tracing the disease, if certain information such as “city of origin” isn’t included, we can’t trace it back.

Instead of easily communicating and giving the needed information, why does the SG Govt seems reluctant? If the information is already sent through another system what’s the harm communicating directly with our representative.

Also, here in Indonesia we heard that SG Govt doesn’t cover medical expenses for Indonesian Nationals. (I do hope that this is not true.) But even so, our Embassy are obliged to cater and support the well-being of our nationals. Restricting such information to our embassy just makes everything harder.

The reason why it is no longer free is because certain citizens boarded a plane to Singapore while they knowing they are sick with covid19 symptoms. Their irresponsible behaviour put the innocent passengers and crews in the plane , airport personnels and taxi uncles at risk.

Bilateral communication. Why do you have to use intermediary in cases like this. Indonesia wants to protect its citizens so why limit the information on our nationals? Also if you are already giving it through other channels, what’s the harm of using bilateral channels? It doesn’t make any sense.

IHR lets both countries' respective ministries of health to communicate directly with each other. What is that if not bilateral communication?

> Indonesia wants to protect its citizens so why limit the information on our nationals? 

Has any reliable source reported this? Because ST is reporting otherwise.


""Singapore has promptly shared information with Indonesia through the official IHR channel on all the confirmed Covid-19 cases involving Indonesians to facilitate contact tracing in Indonesia,"" it said.

A multilateral channel. Where everyone can see everyone's post. Which may be risky to share sensitive details, therefore bilateral channels are more effective in certain area such as ironing out the details.

> It's explicitly set up for crises like this, why wouldn't you use it? 

I didn't say **don't use it,** I only highlighted if it were true, that the SG gov't have given the information through IHR, what's the harm of giving the same information through bilateral channels?

> Is there any difference between us having a conversation on reddit vs facebook messenger? 

As I have mentioned above, yes. It is more private, the details may only be accessed by the parties involved. Furthermore it also help more ""close"" coordination between the parties without bombarding the system with messages that disturb other parties. 

> It is  therefore reprehensible that Indonesia’s spokesman for COVID-19  matters, Achmad Yurianto, decided to initiate a “he said, she said”  screaming match with Singapore over who is lying over whether the  city-state, a regional trade hub, has relayed necessary information  regarding imported COVID-19 cases  from Indonesia. 

As [Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/03/15/covid-19-indonesia-should-get-grip-on-reality-and-work-with-singapore.html) have mentioned above, this case will only become ""he said, she said"". I'm only offering the view of Indonesian Government on the case, which claims that SG withhold necessary information of our nationals. 

To be fair, IMO this is only a case of miscommunication at the lower levels from both SG and ID health officials in the early moments of the outbreak, and quite possibly have been cleared today as [our embassies (MoFA) now relayed information to our MoH](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/15/covid-19-indonesia-finally-begins-contact-tracing-of-patients-who-tested-positive-in-singapore.html) and have begun tracing. 

In the same article our MoFA also highlighted that the communication should be inter-ministerial from MoH to MoH, however knowing how sometimes there are problems within and surrounding the system, whether it is the human resource capacity to use it, or limited information given, etc. Perhaps we also look at the effectiveness of the IHR system itself.

=== Author: bananafever===
>A multilateral channel. Where everyone can see everyone's post. Which may be risky to share sensitive details, therefore bilateral channels are more effective in certain area such as ironing out the details.

You're making quite a huge assumption here, why would it not be possible for two parties to share extra information privately?

Do you have any reports on it being an explicitly open forum only with no way of direct communication? Otherwise I'm not sure why they would intentionally make it impractical.


>As Jakarta Post have mentioned above

As OP has already touched on this, I'll have to ask again. Is Jakarta Post reliable? Is it even the main news outlet in Indonesia and if not, are there any other reliable sources reporting the same thing?

>In the same article our MoFA also highlighted that the communication should be inter-ministerial from MoH to MoH

It also says

""the standard protocol implemented worldwide was that information sharing was supposed to be conducted through inter-ministerial communication ""

The standard protocol they're referring to is the IHR channel because MoHs don't communicate directly with each other, as per standard protocol. 

That's not how it's done in the US and I'm sure it's not done that way in Singapore either.

If JB goes down, Singapore goes down. The two cities are inextricably linked. I think we would know the instant that the situation got bad in JB.

At the same time, you shouldn't travel if you don't feel comfortable. That would just be counter-productive as well.

I would add that exacerbating factors for the hit rate for Singaporeans could be that they might have travelled back together, and/or even known each other casually (same mosque etc). We can't easily extrapolate the hit rate that way.

Sooner or later they will have to explain why there are so many clusters popping up from those who didn't go overseas other than the ""there are those socially irresponsible people who work, play, go out etc. despite feeling unwell"" reasons... Since this virus is already infectious while the person is asymptomatic.

I mean, Singapore was one of the first countries to report the case in the world, and while it seems to be under control, bear in mind the measures that were in place early on. If this is the start of a real outbreak, I can't imagine the past 1+ month measures being escalated much further to reflect the worsening scenario we will be facing in imported cases. 

The issue is with the reactions shown when Dorscon Orange was announced, and the fact that the Singapore elections has to be done before Apr 2021.

In whatever case, attitudes and mentalities must change, extreme attitudes such as anxiety-inducing panic-buying and rumour-mongering (such as sharing unverified WhatsApp messages) must stop, because also, normally after a period of tension there would be complacency. For a while many people wore masks even when they are not sick, while recently there are quite a number of sick people who don't wear masks.

They’re not mad at us for withholding information. They’re mad at us for reporting to the world that Indonesians are being detected to be infected with the virus only when they come to Singapore and not in Indonesia itself. It exposes how widespread the infection really is in Indonesia and how much the government is trying to cover up or play down the situation. The part about us withholding information, whether it’s true or not, is just trying to deflect the blame away from their own incapabilities.

=== Author: Taurus9943===
“The Twitter-based community movement set up to raise awareness on the coronavirus, @KawalCOVID19, writes: “Isn’t the Health Ministry ashamed that an Indonesian national has to migrate to another country to be tested and treated for COVID-19?”

Yurianto, however, dismissed the claim, saying that he believed that the Indonesian nationals treated for  COVID-19 in the neighboring country did not contract the virus in Indonesia, or that they might have influenza-like illnesses but still tested negative for coronavirus.”

Wonder how many indos have already died from “influenza” or “pneumonia” while they keep getting gaslighted about having coronavirus. Since they accuse Singapore of withholding information, they also need to give us vital information about the situation in their country, such as: how many people are confirmed with Covid? What is the contact tracing procedure like? What is the quarantine procedure like? How many suspected cases? We also need THEIR information because they are a high-risk neighbouring country that is still not banned from traveling to Singapore. Alas, they can’t give us any valuable information about the situation there either because they dgaf.

I don't deny the fact that Indonesia has or might have done contact tracing, but the thing is: is the rigour of it sufficient? Or yet, are the measures put in place to prevent community spread or exporting cases enough? Thus, the number of 69 might have been underreported, and the govt of Indonesia needs to do more, or maybe come clean with the number and locations of cases to prevent further spread. 

Btw, I hope you can be nicer to strangers on the internet. Calling us 'ignorant dumbfucks' and using sarcasm isn't going to prove your point. Same goes for some other people here.

Hospitals have an obligation to maintain confidentiality. If we give the info to Indonesia against the patient’s wishes, Singapore’s reputation as medical hub will take a hit. Problem lies with the patients.

=== Author: Corner_Post===
I think this is fairly complex. They are on SNG soil and would need to abide by Singaporean law. If part of it was to provide information to the Singapore Government then legally they would need to abide. It’s just like if the Indonesian government wanted to arrest someone in another country then they would need to ensure they have extradition treaty etc. with that country to get them back or to make a country arrest the person. Given what they have done is not criminal then currently there is no obligation for the Singapore Government to force the people to tell them everything and then to pass onto the Indonesian government. Singapore is just trying to let the people do it of their own accord if they want at the moment - it is odd though that the people have not co-operates (maybe they have own reasons - I don’t know).

Right.

In a country that has 270 million people, you really believe they have 69 cases, 'spread' by the first 2 cases.

And no, I am not saying they need to track airplanes to do contact tracing. BUT if they want to find who came to Singapore, tracking the people who had left Indonesia for Singapore should be achievable, using their custom and immigration system and especially since one of them came on a plane to Seletar Airport... I don't know how many Indonesians can do that, but I don't think it will be a very big number.

No one believes that. Not even the poor & uneducated Indonesians believe that.

That's why they need to get the identity of those selfish, rich assholes who seek treatment in your country so they can find another cluster.

Edit:

>BUT if they want to find who came to Singapore, tracking the people who had left Indonesia for Singapore should be achievable, using their custom and immigration system and especially since one of them came on a plane to Seletar Airport...

I don't see countries parting with their medical personnel to help them though, not while they have their own populations to take care of. Most of them are sending medical supplies at this stage, only China seems to be [sending a team](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fhqbj8/the_chinese_doctors_squad_just_arrived_in_italy/) to help other countries with their treatment because they are battle hardened at this point.

More than just a chop on the passport. Given biometric scanning and tracking, various countries probably share electronic data on a traveller's history.

=== Author: yetinomad===
Good question.  Many countries do not stamp passports upon entry, and even more don’t stamp at departure because many countries simply have no border control at departure.  I have always wondered what info a border control official sees when they scan the passport.  From what I’ve seen when I’ve been able to see their screens, it’s usually a simple ok or not ok - like not on an ineligible for entry list.

Like bare minimum 1k? Low expectations, but with a catch; the income has to be 'passive' and consistent.

Been in tech related field for 10 years and still going strong. I see money does have diminishing returns, although it can be relative to personal expectations and life circumstances. So I kinda agree with the study you quoted, about annual income of USD 75k ish.

When I was a guy, I was started with peanuts, but with stable increases with each change of job every 2 to 3 years, until an okish level.

Now that I am a girl, I am suddenly earning bucketloads. Feels weird but I kinda noticed many ladies seem to earn more than guys. Hmm!

Money did help with my overall happiness as a person, but I realized being able to do what I really want to do matters the most. That is irregardless of how much I earn. 

Money can provide more options and some level of basic security, but thats all. I do acknowledge that for some people, this is everything to them, hence their basic happiness is somehow driven by money. I do agree, it is part of reality. Perhaps also about Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

=== Author: moonandmilk===
It’s quite hard to spend more than what you make — most people spend within their means at least in SG

A US based study showed that happiness increases with more money up to a point (about US $75,000) — was curious about what that number might look like in SG

Everywhere you walk there’s information … There’s a confidence in that information, in the government and what they’re saying, and there’s an expectation you should follow it.” The country gives a bit of money to people who don’t have the kinds of jobs that support being out of work—and fines people who don’t follow the rules.

Not sure if this matters to you, but Dr Vivian isn't the one handling Covid-19, although he likely has some minor role (he is an eye doctor after all).  He is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, like your Secretary of State.  Although, knowing the GOS, he likely has been very deeply briefed, at the very least.  His department has a direct stake or a process expertise on many logistical issues e.g. keeping international supply lines open, managing the finer details and exceptions to border closures, etc.

The way it was explained to me is that Japan is great when they have a plan. When they get taken by surprise they aren't very flexible.

=== Author: fool168===
Firstly, Japan wasn’t hit by SARS in 2003. 

And the with 2020 Tokyo Olympic coming, they are reluctant to test strictly so their confirmed cases won’t go up. Speaking to a Japanese acquittance online, the situation there is really bad, the doctors in his town only test u for the corona virus if you have fever for 3 days and so.

=== Author: adognow===
At the highest levels, Japan is run very poorly. The government has been resting on its laurels for decades, squandering the collective efforts of the country since the end of the war. It's been in economic malaise since the early 90s, and the totally preventable nuclear meltdown in 2011 are just some of the indications. It's the public services at the bottom of the rung that give the impression that the country is run well. Otherwise, economic mismanagement, the mismanagement of this covid epidemic, and high-level judiciary and police dysfunction (and brutality) are the order of the day.

Yes, but the topic on hand was VB's thoughts on US and China, and how these countries respond/handle the outbreak. It's clear they were trying to instigate a sensationalized response, but VB, knowing better, handled it pretty well, imo.

As someone who used to live in Japan, I can confirm this is incredibly accurate.

My favorite lighthearted example of this: I tried to order a cheese pizza from a pizza place in Tokyo that did not have a cheese pizza on the menu. They said no.

I then tried to order a pepperoni pizza, but asked (in Japanese) to just not put the pepperoni on. They said no. 

Beaten down, I then ordered a pepperoni pizza and it arrived hot, perfectly prepared, and exactly on time.

Not true. Japan is patently unprepared to deal with a pandemic- go read up on how their leadership handled the diamond princess case. I recall one of the most amazing things I read was how government officials handling the case were not screened after they disembarked the ship. The reason? If all of them were screened and quarantined, there would be no one left in their health ministry to do any work. 

Japan has many things going for it, but it's governance isn't as wonderful as people think.

There's no perfect system, and I am not Singapore's government dog; I am critical of my government too. But I would like to think that Singapore's system is the closest to discouraging corruption and encouraging service for the good of society.

Yeah I'm sorry but i don't think it has got anything to do with race..it was really because of YOG and the whole fund thing. Besides i don't think singaporeans would be against a minority as a PM.

I guess shutting down travel from some of our ASEAN neighbors is tough because: 

1. Being in close proximity means that any actions will have long-term repercussions (see the [spat](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-austria/italy-demands-austria-lift-unjustified-border-health-checks-idUSKBN20Z2HT) going on between Austria and Italy right now)
2. Several of them are not reporting numbers, so you can't even say you're basing your decision on data without calling them out as liars. Again, not a great look.

That being said, I love the diplomatic shade being thrown by the government 

> Singaporeans should also be cautious when travelling to other countries hit by the deadly virus, including Indonesia, Philippines and the UK, it said.


Nothing formal, but just enough to let them know that they need to buck up soon. Diplomacy is Singapore's first line of defence always.

Refined oil goes the other way and Indon never undercut us for Russia or Aus

Economic relations dont mature overnight and something like banning its citizens becuase of 34 officially comfirm cases will have long term repercussions  which will be a diplomatic and economic nightmare for us down the road.

Slightly off topic, but I find the names ""novel coronavirus"" and ""coronavirus disease"" (covid) damn stupid.

Of course it's novel, otherwise it would be called one of the existing names. Now that you call it novel, the next time we have another coronavirus it would be ""new novel coronavirus 2030""?

""coronavirus disease"" also. Like that every other strain of flu should be ""virus disease"" or ""bacteria disease"". And HIV would be ""retrovirus disease"". 

No consistency at all.

It's not a matter consistency but rather of policy changes.

Diseases used to be named after people and sometimes places, but these are always controversial because of disputed discoverer or location of discovery. Some, like Wegener's granulomatosis (it has a new name now - granulomatosis with polyangitis), was named after a Nazi scientist who did human experimentation in concentration camps.

Therefore, newly named diseases tend to have more practical names that reflect their character more accurately and also avoids controversy. 

This has been a change widely agreed by medical professionals worldwide after a long period of negotiation.

Besides, this falls in line with the general character of medical practice everywhere that seeks to avoid playing the blame game because it serves no purpose. People could argue all day that diseases like diabetes or heart failure are technically self-inflicted, but how does that help the situation? Nobody ever changed someone else's mind by being confrontational or accusatory.

=== Author: trashmaker===
They are trying to create consistency I think. If there is another new coronavirus in 2013, they'd call it Covid-30.

=== Author: botoxilum===

Didnt say they are in the same category. It is the same concept of how you tried to argue that “established use” is a justification for continued usage.

Edit: In case you don't get it without the context of enslaved persons... it is no longer acceptable by society at large to call people ""retarded"" or Chinks or Japs. You can do it among friends privately if you really want to but not formally or even on the internet. So this ""but we have been calling it Wuhan since forever (actually 2 months)"" is not a justification to keep calling it that.

That's just a theory, and it just happens to be the latest one. There've been various theories in the past that it originated from Britain/France. They just found extra documetation that showed a bunch of Chinese labourers moving to Europe around the same time period so they theorised that maybe it was them. But nobody can know for sure.

""History state"" is a completely untrue statement to use here.

No? It's to ensure that China doesn't get to shirk responsibility. The entire reason for this widespread outbreak is due to the fact that China silenced the whistleblowers of the disease as early as in January, resulting in a delayed response.

In JB, he has a terrace house, 2 cars and a motorbike. And he goes to another state on weekends to visit his daughter, who despite studying in uni, has her own place to stay that was purchased by her father. Long weekends can go tioman etc.

=== Author: deaddontopen===
Mid-level executive. He's not a young guy and has worked in the company for decades so he built up a pretty good nest egg. As he doesn't contribute to CPF, he would need to save up for his own retirement. I would think for comparison, a Singaporean with family at his pay level would be staying at a 5-room HDB flat or suburban condo, and possibly a family car as well. But with the exchange rate and standard of living, that goes a loooooong way in Malaysia.

=== Author: gametheorista===
They have 10k untraced from the mosque incident. Contacted and tested 5k - of those, Covid-19 positive rate is 400+, so running 10%.

Means they likely have minimum.1 k or more Covid-19 cases wandering in the general population. If R0 is 3.88 and doubling is 2.9 days, the lock down allows them to break the curve.

Non Pharmaceutical intervention broke R0 in China to 0.38. Malaysians are hoping for the same. 

Weather seems to be on their side since outdoor spread in Singapore has been minimal. Has all been indoor.

=== Author: mengamimi===
Wuhan closed with 400 cases. Also reported cases lag true cases by about 14 days. Also in this situation, it's better to over react than under. Not a doctor, just what I read from that Medium article.

=== Author: ArtStruggle===
Closing borders makes it easier to track cases and it's harder for the virus to spread.  It's why they closed off Wuhan.  Other countries will probably start closing off cities within countries, not just the country borders.  Hopefully, with proper containment, the virus will stop spreading and the healthcare systems won't be overwhelmed.  Once the healthcare systems are overwhelmed, then we're all fucked, like in Italy.

=== Author: pebblesdoge===
Imo it's an indication that they simply aren't able to handle the situation right now. They probably close the borders now to give themselves enough time to sort out a strategy to deal with their situation internally first.

Just my guess:

\- Situation in Malaysia out of control. 500+ only a small portion.

\- no one take the issue seriously and more clusters showing up as people still parties and gather as usual.

\- Hospital overloaded.

\- Divert attention from the political drama.

Could be because they don't have enough resources hence they are not sure how to handle the situation and the simplest solution is to close place a lockdown.

=== Author: ngrenjie===
I suspect Malaysia has basically no idea how bad the situation is or how to even go about monitoring the situation. So their only solution is to keep everyone at home and adopt a wait and see approach.

=== Author: DevilDjinn===
It's called flattening the curve. Presumably Malaysia believes that they will be hitting the peak of the infection soonish. By closing borders they hope to reduce the amount of stress placed on their healthcare system when the peak does hit so that they can reopen borders later on and the hospitals won't be flooded, since they would have dealt with the initial flood, in the ideal case. Less stress = better healthcare = better CFR.

Of course this is assuming this is what's actually going through their mind. Who knows what the gov is actually thinking.

=== Author: malaysianlah===
What  I think : 

1. Italian studies say 50-75% asymptomatic. means contact tracing isn't effective, and will not slow down the case growth if left unchecked.
2. Social distancing is the only solution to prevent an overwhelming of Malaysia's already limited healthcare system.. Malaysians are by nature lawless and need a heavy handed approach. This is the only solution, really.

=== Author: None===

=== Author: BuffDarkKnight===
The only reason I can think of if *touch wood* Singapore close the borders is when our health system is fully overwhelmed..

satoshigekkouga2303,I don’t advocate for school closures in any way. But the measures taken in school to tackle the Covid situation is questionable imo. Just reporting what I see as a JC student. Feel free to tear me apart or whatever.,150,fhi3cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fhi3cp/i_dont_advocate_for_school_closures_in_any_way/,63,1584055818.0,"I think most of y’all would have already known that Singapore is one of the only few countries that refuses to shut schools down even with an outbreak. According to ministry of education, there have been various steps taken by all schools to ensure the safety and well-being of students. It is often argued by the government that school closure will simply result in high rates of secondary to tertiary students mingling around outside of schools due to closure. I’ll attempt to detail the measures my school has taken in an attempt to cope with the clusters in Singapore. Do take note that I am currently in pre-university/Junior College education. 

1. Daily morning temperature checks. It’s religiously conducted every morning and the school has provided everyone with a personal thermometer. However, as we all know, fever as a symptom only occurs after the incubation period. 

2. Daily usage of soap water to wipe our tables. This measure was an initiative by the student body and it seems to be slightly questionable in my opinion. Most people don’t really take this seriously and it instills a false sense of security in the student body + Teachers. 

3. No usage of air-conditioning before 11am. Yea they banned the usage of air-cons before 11am, coz we all know that covid-19 isn’t legally allowed to enter your body after 11am without your permission. 

4. Staggered recess/lunch timing. This is utter BS. Nothing was staggered, it just so happens that my lunch time occurs alongside every single level in the school. Hundreds of students all gathered in canteen together at the same time. Nothing was done to even break these groups up. 

5. Cancellation of competition, school events/ after school events etc. Not taken seriously by the student body either and neither is it being enforced by Teachers. 

6. One seat apart from each other during lectures. Yes, it’s done to space us out. And yes, in a lecture theatre. 

7. Disinfection of mass areas. Such as the library or various lab areas. This one’s pretty well done. 

8. And saving the best for last. Video lectures but with everyone gathered in the lecture theatre to watch it. (I do admit that this might not be a measure at all. The videos were pre-recorded last year and are now being used again for the next batch of students in lecture. Pretty meme worthy moment for the students tho.)

Please understand that I’m not advocating for school closure. I don’t even want school to be closed as they’ll simply pile online learning on us. I’m advocating for more stringent and thorough measures in schools. Most students don’t even take the situation seriously, I have been seeing sick students attend lessons and just joking about the situation as a whole. The measures that have been taken (in my school) is questionable to say the least. But who am I to judge?",2020-03-13 07:30:18,"

When the NUS professor became a confirmed case (even though he wasn't on the premises since he showed symptoms), we were told not to hold classes for two weeks and stayed home instead. Classes were held online on a powerful skype hosting app and surprisingly, it all worked out! Especially so since my classes are tutorial-intensive, hands-on activities and not lecture based.

Of course, there were a few muggers that sneaked into school, although they were quickly chased out by cleaners.

After the brief stay-at-home stint, we too had to report temperature takings daily. Those who didn't have a thermometer were sent downstairs and given their [own](https://cdns.webareacontrol.com/prodimages/1000-X-1000/2/r/24820173193M-Tempa-DOT-Oral-and-Axillary-Thermometer-L.png). The class wouldn’t start until everyone was accounted for, and lecturers would take photos for contact tracing purposes. However, I felt that this temporary measure was only made possible bc the student body is incredibly small with a high teacher to student ratio. The classrooms were open-plan with minimal enclosed spaces, which probably meant any disease will spread rampantly if someone gets it.

Unfortunately— just yesterday, a student was identified a close contact and... the cycle repeats again.

Edit: After two weeks of online classes however, it became quite apparent that some of us were behind on work.

The government has said that school closures may be necessary.  They have reacted quickly to shut down places where there is evidence of risk (mosques, PA activities) but there is so far no evidence of spread within schools.  This may be a year-long thing, as the PM said, so we need to save the right measures for the right time.

=== Author: ballsie995===
at JC level, dont the student body have a rather high say in things? if not, bring out the big guns — parents make noise to school or MP. 

the biggest issue is the sick (if the virus symptoms) still attend school — refer to “socially irresponsible” speech by our minister. 

the aircon one is HUH? anyhow out of nowhere. the higher temperature of few degrees is not exactly conclusive in killing off the virus, and higher humidity (everyone sweating in the room) may help the virus spread too. 

the staggering timetable, i heard its a tough math problem. i am not sure teachers can solve it that well, or have the tech to solve it. most JC recess are somewhat staggered already no? as compared to sec/pri school. 

a lot of the rest is more like cultural problem despite the right intention to help the situation... for that its a leadership problem lor. 

for Uni or preU, closing schools really should not affect much learning. since self study, tech, discipline all should be there liao, and old enough to take care of themselves without a burden to the parents.

As a sec 4 student taking O's this year, I really hope that school's don't close since learning in a classroom with the teacher being physically there to teach you is much better than through texts or videos specifically for school closure situations. Honestly, I can't really be bothered to do e-learning at times lul and would rather do handwritten work.

My secondary school is doing mostly the same things (except the air con one that's just weird) heck we were supposed to take temperature before remedials start but most teachers just ignore it lul.

In my opinion, compared to other countries, I feel that Singapore is not at that stage for school closure yet. Looking at the statistics it looks rather contained, 178 cases with more than half being discharged. As long as we are not stupid enough to let our guard down and start touching our face and not wash our hands for some strange reason, we should be fine to get through this.

There is a solid argument at this point to shut down schools. At least for teenagers who can look after themselves at home and basically have no impact on economy (impact on economy is if parents are forced to look after primary age kids during day)

I wish people would stop dismissing temperature checks like it's utterly useless. You do not know if you're sick unless you have the symptoms, and fever is one of the earliest symptoms that confirms that you're sick.

Regular temperature checks ensures early detection and therefore limits the spread of the disease. So instead of infecting 30, you might have only infected 5.

Also, of course fever occurs after the incubation period. Incubation period, by definition, is the time between infection and the first showing of symptoms.

=== Author: sgslang===
The biggest threat is from people with symptoms who do not put on mask and still insists in going to school, work, play or social events. We should stop  classmate, colleague, friend around us from such act. 

It is not enough to just keeping ourselves safe, but also reminding others and preventing them from being a spreader.

=== Author: danielling1981===
Let's just say that often instructions are given but it's the people not following them.

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Cleaning tables is fair point but people taking it for granted in school will take it for granted at home or if school is closed. So just stay away from these friends of yours. Since you can see means same class rooms means at least acquaintance. 

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

There is a reason for air con.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-turn-off-air-conditioners-and-open-windows-to-reduce-risk-of-being

But u choose to interpret it as a lame and give some lame reasons for the schools instruction.

That's on you.

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Recess.

It is very likely that the school has also given instructions to have space between each other which is unlikely to be followed.

So again. Irresponsible behaviour will occur regardless of age or ethics or location.

As for staggering, did you expect 1 class at a time for recess?

No. Probably it is staggered but the crowd still builds up. But due to previous group not leaving, it will still seem to be un staggered.

Not sure how it was managed but there could be limited time to stay at canteen but people are not following instructions.

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Temp taking agree is lame. But it is still a preventive measure.

Otherwise might as well be a country lockdown for 3 weeks. Only sick people can come out to see doctor.

Not going to work for us and not at the stage where this is even necessary. 

ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Point 5 is valid and should be brought up.

And sick students attending should be reported as well.

Our measures rely a lot on people being responsible. It does not makes sense (yet) to close schools due to a few irresponsible people.

You should do your part to report those cases to your teacher / school.

OP, I gotta affirm your courage in choosing to open up a difficult topic here in a way that welcomes deliberative discussion. Don't be too harsh on yourself there :) 

That said, I have similar struggles at work... People simply don't take these issues seriously, and they're very comfortable living life as per normal OR even exploiting the chance to take the easy way out. I usually run projects (deployment and enforcement) for companies, so based on behavioral sciences people don't change unless there are catastrophic forces to shift their paradigms. But once these forces dissipate, most people fall back into their old ways quite quickly.

Unless there are serious punitive punishments (along with incentives), it doesn't make sense for people to hold onto new norms. If you can escalate these issues to the right channels, I think there should be someone who's able to effect changes. What's worked for me in the past was raising it to my grassroots leader, who blew the whistle directly to our MP, who passed word along to the civil service.

=== Author: bobo_chacha===
The temperature taking is so lame. If you have a fever it's already too late. It means you spent the last 2 weeks spreading the virus already.

I feel like these BS measures are just being implemented so that people can say they did something. Doesn't matter if it actually accomplishes anything or not. So that if an infection is discovered in the institution the management can say ""well we already implemented XYZ"".

Singapore hasn't been forced to close schools because the early proactive response helped limit community spread. I'm pretty sure school closures are not out of the question, and I've never really heard that argument you're saying. [LHL says](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-remarks-COVID-19-Outbreak-12-Mar-2020):
>Besides medical plans, if there is a spike, we will also need additional social distancing measures. These will be temporary like suspending school, staggering work hours, or compulsory telecommuting. They will be extra “brakes”, to be implemented when we see a spike in cases. The extra brakes will slow down transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and help bring the numbers back down. After the situation improves, we can ease off and go back to the baseline precautions.

So I think if clusters develop in schools, school would be suspended.

Regarding the specifics:

1. Makes sense, as transmission is more likely when symptomatic. Viruses aren't magic dust; whether you get infected depends on how many virus particles (the inocula size) you come into contact with.
2. Kinda silly. Maybe it helps, but idk.
3. Probably a balance between afternoon temperatures being too crazy and reducing air-con usage. Once again, it's not necessarily to halt spread, it's to limit it, and spending less time in air-con reduces risk due to the same reason I mentioned in 1. It's really _not_ all or nothing.
4. lmao
5. Theoretically a good measure, but teachers should enforce more.
6. This seems like a good measure.
7. Seems fine too
8. Really sounds like it's not a COVID measure.

Try complaining to MP or MOE, they might force the school to do more.

Would you like the NTU Business School version?

Points 1 to 7 does not apply.

Temperature taking is self-declared.

Seminar-like lessons of 50 people is still being held

People still congregate in the canteen.

Despite having e-lectures, the staunch refusal to go entirely electronic as compared to other schools such as engineering, communications, social sciences makes me shudder to think if an outbreak is to occur in NTU.

We are almost 2/3rds done with the semester and at this point, I don't want the school to close and have my quizzes and exams delayed because of the faculty indecisiveness to close or not.

The next point is electronic learning has made learning cumbersome and extremely frustrating. I only had a module that became electronic and the work done is amounts to furnishing a proper business report within a week. So much for electronic learning.

The problem is humanity selfish behavior. Selfish people are causing the virus to spread. If us humans do not start changing our ways then the virus will eradicate us. 

Even though we do not have any deaths caused by the virus in Singapore, we must not act complacent. The rate of active cases are increasing. When we run out of hospital beds people WILL DIE.

We must work together, act selflessly, treat every human as how we treat our beloved and the virus will be eliminated.

Thanks for the insight. We also have daily temperature taking but it’s extremely lax and not even the teachers seem to take it seriously. There is zero enforcement or checks by Teachers as to whether your temperature is above 37.8/38.0/or whatever reading they decide to set on that day. It seems to be up to the student’s discretion as to whether or not you have a fever. Temperature isn’t taken down or recorded somewhere and you’re simply expected to raise your hand if you have a temperature above 38.0.

Cool! I'd guess student motivation would play a huge role. In primary/secondary levels, you need to motivate students, but in tertiary, students tend to be more self-motivated.

The death rate might be low but the >10% severe cases is no joke. I doubt we have ventilators enough for anybody who needs one if there is a huge influx of icu patients. There a reason why Italy and China took the extreme measures similar to red even when it isn't severe.

=== Author: VPee===
We don’t know what’s prompting this. If for example they have a large number of new cases which are a result of local transmission, I’m they will have to raise the DORSCON to Red. The biggest problem is that if the number of sick increase dramatically the medical capacity is not sufficient to handle so many and at the same time prevent more spread (like how it spread even more in China hospitals)

Well I’m also hoping they don’t do it, but this DORSCON thing is a pretty scientific process and they don’t have too much ability to influence it unless they suppress information about number of cases etc.

The government can created additional rules and impose additional fines for hoarding etc to prevent people from behaving erratically. Last time they didn’t estimate how big the reaction would be and were unprepared. Now knowing how people behave they definitely have thought of measures they will take.

I believe they may just announce social distancing and more harder measures to prevent spread in public places.

Or maybe they will just **announce elections** before shit hits the fan!

=== Author: X1yWe4YQx59g===
The study is across 100 cities in China (so more or less the same level of gov't intervention), and the results are statistically significant for both temperature and humidity.  So this is definitely good news both for Singapore and the world.

There \*is\* one important limitation: they only studied places where outbreaks of local transmission happened (>40 cases).  So if there were less outbreaks in warm, humid places, they would not be captured here, meaning the effect would be even larger than measured.

I have been working in my current company for close to 4 years and recently got approach by a recruitment agency who is helping a big US tech MNC client to fulfill a role which I fit.

Everything sounds good but here is the catch

12-month contract base under the recruitment agency (with chance to renew/ conversion to perm under the US MNC)

Benefit could be lower when comparing contractor vs perm(no bonus/leave lower/healthcare benefit expenses lower)

This opportunity open up a new area where i can be expose to newer ground using this as a stepping stone and with a pay increase of up to 40%

Should i take it up even though it is contract based given how the market situation right now(covid/recession/economic downturn) where job stability is much more important?

I am currently early 30's and married without any kids so no finance/family commitment as my BTO will only arrive in 2022 Q1/2

any advice will be appreciated, Thanks",2020-03-17 22:38:20,"
=== Author: Thorberry===
Here's the perspective nobody is giving you: If you've been working at the same company for four years and are now being offered 40% more for some temporary role, you're most likely underpaid to begin with. 

Instead of settling for a contract role -- at Google I assume, but doesn't matter if it's correct -- you can almost definitely find a full-time position with equivalent compensation elsewhere. 

Pursue the contract role. Accept it, even. But start searching for full-time alternatives and do it aggressively. The good thing about contract roles is that you can usually quit them with little notice. It's almost expected that you job search while serving the contract.

=== Author: ongcs===
How big is the jump in salary? If the jump is good, and you are confident in yourself that you will not be jobless even if the contract is not renewed, I will think why not.

=== Author: danielling1981===
Contract is not a dirty word.

Unless they clearly declare no chance for perm, there's always a chance.

And the gain in knowledge and experience will help. Just start looking early rather than waiting for recruiters to contact you.

=== Author: shavedawg===
Loyalty to any company is a dead concept. Any opportunity that can add positive experiences and exposure to your resume must be considered seriously.

=== Author: mengamimi===
The saying a bird in hand goes a long way in a situation like this. Don't get me wrong, I was in contract for around 10 years myself. A contract job is always short term in nature, that means no career prospects. Think about it, if this is a long term role, why do they place it as a contact one? Building a career takes time, one year doesn't cut it. The pay raise is only enough to cover the shortfall in benefits a full time employee enjoys, and to the middleman. In a recession, which is likely just around the corner, contract workers are first to go. So it's really up to you, if you are planning for short term, grab the cash, forget about benefits, then contract is the way to go. If you're building a career, choose a full time job.

=== Author: alvinherexD===
regardless 4 years i think its time to go or get out of your comfort zone. not to mention 40% increment. also this opportunity may open up many new windows for you next time.

=== Author: hanryou===
It depends if you’re looking for short-term gains or long-term career. If you feel this US MNC can benefit you in the long-term horizon (but you may not have as much benefits in the first year or so), then I’d suggest to go for it.

But this is assuming you are unable to / choose not to secure a perm position with equally high pay as this US MNC. Yep, job market seems a little bleak given we’re entering recession & exacerbated by covid.

My civil service friends say that they will be practising some further BCP measures, so they're probably expecting that this is going to get worse. 

Number of active cases is now higher than its ever been. NCID has 330 beds, and each of the hospitals have isolation rooms but I can't imagine that we would be able to deal with more than 500 cases at once, so if it gets there the mild cases are going to have to self isolate at home (as is the case in Europe, USA and South Korea right now)

Lastly, they have limited labour laws, so workers are generally not entitled to paid medical leave, combine with the fact that a significant number of them are [living paycheck to paycheck](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-shocking-number-of-americans-are-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-2020-01-07), so imagine if you are feeling sick but you need to make ends meet and so you can't afford to isolate yourself.

I believe credit can be shared between many parties. Without the government’s foresight and the implementation of many policies, we definitely would have been in a worse place. Many of these things can only be done at the National and international level. They definitely deserve the credit. 

And also my great appreciation to the people in healthcare, regardless of Covid frontline, normal ward nurse or even GP clinic doctor or admin nurse. Everyone has a part to play to keep the system afloat so that it doesn’t spill over to the others and overload them. Not forgetting the allied health people, those in the labs who probably have painstaking done over tens to hundreds of thousands of rest by now. And the researchers and those administrators at MOH for doing their part too. 

The SPF should take some credit for their efforts in contact tracing too, the effort gone into tracing thousands of people definitely isn’t easy. and the SCDF too, every time i see an ambulance nearby, i see the guys decked out in the full DORSCON Orange PPE, it must be hard to wear that for the whole day. And our boys in green should get some too for helping out in some of the back end saikang (they were the ones who packed the four masks for every freaking household)

You see, getting through this virus outbreak, it’s not just you, or me, or the Aunty coughing in the mrt but luckily wearing mask. It really is the combined effort of so many groups of people doing what they do best. What we really need is for everyone to step up and play their part (or really, just not be an asshole if you can’t contribute anything, cue the teenagers spitting or the drinking unpaid drinks video). And to coordinate all these, your government must be good enough to know what they’re doing. Looking around, not many governments are worthy of this compliment. I think ours is, and that’s why they deserve the credit we give.

=== Author: CryonautX===
I don't see a reason to take any credit away from the Government here. We only need to look at places like the US to see that we are doing a good job. This isn't just about the science only. It's about the policies put in place which the government is responsible for.

>How does self isolation at home work? Wouldn't you be at risk of infecting your family, esp your parents and grandparents?

Unfortunately, if we reach that stage, the idea is to contain the virus within each family nucleus. People will still get sick and die from the virus within the family but other families will be protected with this measure. It is one of the hard choices we will be forced to make at that point when we don't have enough quarentine facilities.

Nononono. As in, if you wanna get tested, it's gonna be expensive af. Like, they have to pay to get tested.

Essentially, what's happening over there is that some people **can't** get tested even if they wanted/needed to because of how expensive it is.

=== Author: Brikandbones===
Yes, and that is how their Covid issues are going to blow through the roof. Because if it costs so much to get tested, not to even say get hospitalised, there will be a lot of people who are not going to go get tested even if they suspect they might have gotten it, solely because of the cost itself. 

And then add on the antivaxxers and the Covid denial people and you've got a real good shit storm brewing.

How would you know if you recover? And even after you recover your family would probably have to disinfect the hell out of the room.

Sigh, hope this outbreak resolves itself soon

I think the timing is just right. Cases are spiking everywhere and the likelihood is we might get a 2nd wave. WHO just raised the level to Pandemic as well. 

If you don’t say anything and shit hits the fan in maybe 2 weeks, there could be a larger panic. Simply acknowledging everything now and updating us on the forecast and countermeasures (both medically and economically), helps calm the nerves. That way, if things do end up worse, we don’t hit our individual panic button ASAP.

... I rather take MC then spend 3k for a possible +ve if i only have mild symptoms.

Hey if after 3 days my fever subsided but I still have some coughing, I can still go to work right? Since no way to tell if this is covid or normal flu, I already used up my full year MC and I still need a job to keep and earn my living.
Mask? I can’t get any with the shortage in supermarkets.

And ppl start wondering workplace a lot of ppl coughing lately...

Capitalism at its finest with demand and supply.
That’s why healthcare doesn’t really work great for capitalism.

=== Author: Blargasaur===
The stringent requirements are still in effect. The government is still trying to keep panic down by not testing people and getting accurate numbers. Leaders are more concerned with the economic impacts than the health impacts. Where I live they stood up one drive through testing center. That's it. For almost 6M people. They advised people to bring water and food because the wait will likely be several hours. Furthermore you need a doctors note to get tested at the drive through, and doctors are only giving those out if you can prove you were exposed to someone with a confirmed case and are showing severe symptoms. But no one is really able to get tested so it's pretty hard to do. A friend working at a hospital told me this morning they have over 30 suspected cases in quarantine, but there are no available tests. I fear it is spread much more than we realize. We won't know though, because they aren't testing most cases. Gotta keep the stock market up!

Our local government and leaders are still encouraging people to get out and spend money because we don't want our businesses losing revenue. If schools here have a confirmed case they will close for 72 hours then resume normal operations, because parents can't take time off work. People are still going out and partying, going to concerts, movies, etc. Most American's don't understand social responsibility, and many of them view it as socialism/communism or a threat to their rights. It's really strange how people react to things like this. I fear it's going to get real bad real fast here. I really hope I am wrong.

=== Author: CryonautX===
Of course we can! A lot of people are deserving of credit and scientists are indeed among them. Those responsible enough to self quarantine also deserve credit for example. Among scientists, the team at Duke NUS that helped make the test kits for example  have contributed a lot to containment efforts. 

Although I wouldn't go as far as to say that they are the real heroes. Healthcare professionals, doctors, scdf personnels and everyone who is putting themselves at risk in combatting the pandemic. Surely, they are the real heroes. Like the doctor that went to the hotspot of Wuhan to study the situation and advise on policies for Singapore.

And with other countries fact/propaganda “Most of the time Covid is actually a mild disease, just highly infectious than normal”

Given the cost of testing and hospitalization fee, if I am one of the lower income group, I would be *force* to work. I rather work for earning a living and let my immunity fight it through, then go isolation do test and hospitalize if unfortunately got it, and incur a heavy debt that I know I have no way to pay.

Rather have risk of possible no bread tomorrow vs confirm no bread today.

Given this you must applause how other countries gov is willing to absorb this cost barrier and encourage testing.

Its viable and possible to set up a temp medical facility there should numbers become big and pple need to be quarantined there. For the medical staff, its sort of like the folks in the O&G industry working on Jurong Island, they just stay there in shifts. Fun fact, St John Island was once used as a medical rehab centre for opium addicts.

=== Author: Blargasaur===
> ... or this is common sense, just US gov is stupid -\_- 

So far it looks like the US Government tested 8 samples yesterday.  

And today the president blamed the lack of testing on people just not going to get tested. Stupid, incompetent, malicious. Take your pick. Doesn't really matter at this point IMO. Waiting for the tables to turn and the US to get travel bans from other countries. I have a feeling were going to blow China's numbers out of the water.  

A prominent government doctor today estimated we could be looking at between 70-150M infected. And that doesn't even begin to look at the impact on business and people losing their homes and jobs, companies shutting down, etc.   

The only financial assistance the government has talked about so far is payroll tax cuts that would mostly relieve some pressure on businesses and the upper class, and subsidies for oil and gas companies, I believe some others but I honestly couldn't stomach the articles. Banks promised to allow small businesses and individuals to take out loans (with interest of course) to help make it through. It seems like they are treating it like a business opportunity. People elected a businessman, not sure why they expected different. Like I said, I don't see this ending well.

I think most would understand. It's really not that unreasonable. If the safety and health of the ummah is compromised then cancelling of Friday prayer is definitely acceptable.

Shouldnt they be closed for 2 weeks to prevent community spread? 5 days is pretty short for incubation time

Just a note to all that are curious, the prayers have to be held at one location, the sermon however can be downloaded from the MUIS website, both in malay and english translation.

Question: I’ve attended 2 of the mosques where the COVID19 person frequented. Should I self isolate for a couple of weeks or be more diligent on hand washing ?

=== Author: Jammy_buttons2===
I wonder if it's possible for online prayers?

=== Author: saifaljaidi1991===
Well you know it's worth it because they think if they gather they can effectively make a DBZ SPIRIT BOMB OF DUA. 

Maybe a lot of them who attended may die, but you know Muslims, the moment the west makes the vaccine fully effective, you’ll get age old classic, “we Muslims prayed for all of mankind and Allah answered”. It’s like literally the same shit over and over again and they can’t see it.

=== Author: snowpyne===
Inevitable and long overdue tbh. Should've done the same when the churches started cancelling Mass. Kinda scared to see how many more cases would turn up because of this, especially with the two weeks period of exposure. I know we Muslims are supposed to practice *tawakal (*leave it to fate/God) but that doesn't mean that one shouldn't take precautions.

And I even still have 3 wedding invitations this weekend. Highly likely that I won't be going.

=== Author: George_W_Bushido===
I think it’s good that MUIS is willing to take this stance, a lot of elderly attend Friday prayers and without a word from mufti or muis they will keep attending.

This virus does not choose to attack just one race/ religion, so people should really stop bringing race or religion into it. Being any race/ religion doesn't grant you immunity from the virus. This is the time where all must work together to fight against the common enemy (virus).

=== Author: pauperwithpotential===
Online friday prayers aren't taboo. Online prayers are just non-existent. The gist of friday prayer is performing in a congregation of at least 40 worshippers. If this is not met, muslims can still perform their zuhor prayer as per their daily 5-time routine.

I know Malaysia live broadcasts their Friday prayers on their TV, but I don't think it's for the benefit of those who are not at the venue. So, I don't think it's allowed since it's supposed to be congregational.

=== Author: _Blythe===
Really? There are so many Buddhist temples and many of them use incense.

Even Wikipedia says “In Chinese Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense in small or large bundles, which they wave or raise above the head while bowing to the statues or plaques of a deity or an ancestor. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers located in front of the statues or plaques either singularly or in threes, depending on the status of the deity or the feelings of the individual. The incense is also used to burn a Buddhist monk or nun's scalp during ordination and the burning usually lasts for 5 minutes, produces 6, 9 or 12 circular scars (called ""jieba"" or ordination scars) on the person's scalp after the person has suffered great pain from the burning.”

10,000 people were on the Tabligh event for four days straight and in close proximity with each other (can google the pics from the event). It's more than enough for a mass virus outbreak to happen. Already 25 out of the 90 Bruneians who attended the event got the Corona Virus. The rest still awaiting the test results. The rate is insane tbh given how the gov only found about patient zero this week in the country. Bruneians are understandaly panicked. I hope everything will be ok in the end...fortunately, so far no one has died. But not sure about the future.

=== Author: Zenobiya===
Sorry? I was referring to the local community, I was not referring to religiosity in any way.  I also don't know any Iranians and I've never been to Iran to sufficiently say whether they are religious, in reference to your question.

=== Author: Zenobiya===
From my observation, mosques around Singapore, of which I can't say all, but a good majority were still holding mass lectures and events against government advise. This, anyone can access on the mosque's Facebook pages. 

At a recent event at a Mosque in central Singapore, I witnessed close to 200 people packed close together in a mosque. Though 200 may not be deemed a mass gathering, it was sufficiently large enough that it was a concern especially taking into account that the mosque did not check for visitors' temperatures and no visitors were asked to declare their travel history or if they are feeling unwell.

There were more events scheduled at that particular mosque, I also saw events at mosques particularly in the East, which would attract close to 100-over people being scheduled.

During Friday prayers since the virus broke out, 3 of the mosques that were close to my vicinity were not checking temperatures or asking worshippers to sign any declarations. I will say it is almost impossible because I observed worshippers arriving at different times. This then throws up questions, in particular, why didn't the worshippers feel the need to demand that the mosque committees put measures in place to monitor the worshippers' conditions, and what can the Muslim community do to improve this?  Why haven't Muslim leaders come forward to assess the situation and impose these measures that offices are implementing?

This is a serious issue that can affect the elderly, which is by and large the age of frequent mosque-goers. Most Muslim men from their teens to senior citizens are visiting mosques in close proximity to other worshippers during Friday prayers, and most people in Singapore are aware that it attracts close to 100-300 worshippers together for about an hour, and if they got infected and were bringing it around to work and home, in my opinion, this signalled a complacency on the part of the community.

If the community isn't asking questions of their leaders, then who will. The Muslim community, and indeed all of us, need to start doing better.

Religions that put their leaders above the state are inherently dangerous since they think they know better.  It’s not a coincidence that Daegu outbreak was spread by a cult.

IIRC the only thing MUIS did back then was to advise the sick to skip Friday prayers and instead pray at home.

=== Author: redditme789===
It’s a subjective value but until the number in this case is even remotely reasonable, this shouldn’t be an issue. 

NUS is cancelling all activities with >50 people. Classes with >50 are cancelled too. That might be a reasonable metric to go by. Since the value is subjective, we can always claim that a gathering of maybe 100 is reasonable to some extent. 

But a gathering that’s 20 times the size of what’s deemed risky? That number isn’t even remotely close to any metric thus far suggested. Therefore, your argument about the subjectivity and recommended cut-off value doesn’t matter simply due to the sheer size and ignorance these people have demonstrated.

Chances of spreading is not low.

Malaysia has just announced that it will restrict all movement throughout the country from 18 March to 31 March to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 within Malaysia. 

Given the close proximity between Singapore and Malaysia, many Singaporeans may be concerned about what this will mean for them. 

The Government has been actively working with essential firms such as NTUC Fairprice, Sheng Siong and Dairy Farm International to increase our stock of food and essential supplies over the last two months. This means that we are not in danger of running out of food or other supplies brought in by our retailers. 

In addition to building up our inventory of food and essential supplies, we also have in place a robust multi-pronged strategy that will ensure we do not run out of the essentials we require. For example, we have local production capabilities for products such as noodles, infant milk powder and canned goods among others. In the event that we need to increase supply for our domestic consumption, we can ramp up quickly and easily to do so. We have also continued to diversify our sources of essential goods, for example we get a good amount of vegetables from China and even go as far as Australia and Spain to secure our supply of eggs. 

Although we are not facing any shortages, I urge everyone to continue to purchase in a responsible manner and to purchase only what you need. Otherwise, no amount of stockpiling will be sufficient. 

Businesses that employ Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily may have to activate their Business Continuity Plans. If they need assistance, they should contact our economic agencies who stand ready to assist.

We will continue to stay in touch with our Malaysian counterparts as the situation evolves. Our priority is to ensure that our people and our businesses are able to continue with their lives and their livelihoods.

I am aware that many of these new restrictions and announcements may be quite overwhelming for many people. I ask for your continued trust and support as we work hard with all stakeholders to ensure that we get through these short-term challenges together. CCS",2020-03-17 07:42:35,"

Weren't you the guy posting the SCDF stockpile guidelines a few weeks ago? It was a good guide for me to build a stash

Seems like everyone conflates all those concepts (hoarding, stockpiling, panic buying) on this sub. What is your definition of panic buying then?

Tbh most people are being kinda rational stocking up at this time because supply chains will be disrupted. You might not get what you want in the next few weeks if you can only purchase at high demand periods and time is money. And Redmart deliveries are already fucked again goddammit so I'll try to hold out as long as I can without having to physically go to a supermarket 

And FWIW I don't think those who bought a fuck ton of toilet paper/instant noodles are panic buying probably looking to make a quick buck

=== Author: ballsie995===
so to you its ok to stockpile 2-3 weeks ago, then now its not ok to stockpile? 

so, if a person bought trolleys of items 2-3 weeks ago, he wouldnt be panic buying?

=== Author: WittyKap0===
No I'm OK to stockpile at any time, if you have less than a week of food supply at home then you should start now.

If your company activates BCP or your nearest hawker center has a cluster then having to brave crowded supermarkets to load up is more risky than stocking up during peacetime.

From the point of view of people who decry stockpiling of any sort, their main complaint is that you deprive others of getting stuff they need or inconvenience others' queue times. Hence my point that stockpiling a couple weeks ago would be less inconvenient for all.

Personally idgaf about what people think though, make my own judgment calls

Edit: I don't see anything morally wrong with panic buying, it's a human reaction to fear. Significant increased demand is going to strain supply chain in the short term, can't be helped. Hence people being prepared and stockpiling during lull periods helps reduce the impulse strain on the system each successive time

Obviously if you buy so much stuff that it gets wasted its probably not great, but I'm another proponent of the opinion that unintended food wastage has done its economic job

=== Author: ballsie995===
yea. i know. i am just offering a means for people to rationalise things. 

myself i started a small stash long ago, like when news of WW3 is probable due to US airstrike, build a little more when virus starts to spread in wuhan+cny. 

by now, i am still only barely having 1 week supply for 3 members in my family — according to scdf guidelines. 2 weeks is the recommended amount just for context.

If the ruling party dares to move this to [electronic voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkH2r-sNjQs) in the face of Covid, this could cause hell. Cause there'll be a valid reason to stick with electronic voting, and say that it was such a success that it'll continue forever. And trust could very well be eroded with an electronic system *without* a paper trail.

=== Author: resilientsingaporean===
It could also go the other way round where they hold an election immediately after the COVID-19 situation have stabilised (est year end) around the world and in Singapore. What I considered stable is cases around the world rising in small numbers, but the virus is not yet fully eradicated globally. 

Will most likely be a snap election as what then PM GCT did in 2001 following 9/11 and the recession. But overall, they are just waiting for the situation to stabilise first before finding the right time to call for an election. They are most likely to hold the election earliest in Sep as the virus situation will most likely stabilise only until the 2nd half of the year and that July and Aug are off the table as resources will be needed for NDP and PM's rally.

=== Author: Kazozo===
If he was considering extending the Apr 2021 deadline, he won't be bringing it up now. Clearly he means holding it soon.

=== Author: the13thAristocrat===
It depends on how people view their performance. Given all the praise we've garnered from foreign media it makes sense to milk it and call elections while this is still fresh in the people's minds no? Rather than delay and wait till all the positive vibes recede.

=== Author: MythicalZoan===
I don't think too much suggestion has been made that electronic voting ought be used - correct me if I'm wrong tho

But it could still one day be a possibility and be more trustworthy than paper voting. Blockchain tech or hardware encrypted solutions like those used in Estonia, are both viable alternatives to voting. Tho that video did raise issues with them, these solutions will grow more mainstream, gain trust and be more implementable.

In a country with mandatory voting, there probably isn't too much incentive to make voting that easy though since they've already given people time off to vote and have established SOP for the whole process. In any country, actually, increasing voter turnout (like in America or the UK) would be an unfavourable idea among some politicians who rely on a concentrated turnout of their supporters. So maybe we won't see electronic solutions used by most countries to make voting a virtual and detached process.

=== Author: skatyboy===
As a software engineer, no electronic voting will be more trustworthy and secure than paper ballots. It's the only thing that I will never trust going ""electronic"". 

Go volunteer as an election observer next election. Observe how precise the actions of the Presiding Officer at the polling and counting stations, like for instance, raising up the ballot box to show everyone that it is empty before using it. Those actions reassures everyone that there's no magic tricks (e.g. no stuffed boxes, no extra boxes) and you can't physically trick someone when PAP/WP/SDP eyeballs are glued to the box during the elections. 

Blockchain doesn't even make sense for an election, it's like using a hair curler/straightener to flatten a prata. If you're thinking that the publically verifiable ledger is an advantage, it basically breaks a fundamental concept of elections: secrecy of individual ballots and results. The results should not be made known to anyone before the close of polls, as that influences what people vote for. Individual results should not be made known, as one can guess what my friend voted for if I know when he voted. Also, I could be paranoid and think that there are stuffed votes in the blockchain: dead people, made up people. After all, who would give out the private keys to sign the ballot? The government, of course, the entity which wants to stay in power. With paper voting, you need actual people to go queue and vote and that includes ""stuffers"" and fake people.

The problems that arise with remote voting and processes that can't be physically audited with your own eyes makes electronic (or any form of absentee voting) insecure.

Daily cases may be rising but it's not the narrative that's being put out right?

When pictures of people queuing starts flooding my social media, I got out of my bed and head down to the nearest 24hrs supermarket to buy my eggs, cereal, bee hoon, frozen meat and cooking oil. I initially do not understand why would people panic buy in the first wave, but I think I do now. 

**Some people have elderly parents to take care of at home** (persons behind me in the queue)

If the borders with Malaysia are gonna be shut off tomorrow, with no Malaysians getting out or no foreigners coming in, shit is definitely going to hit the fan. A lot of our food services and retail relies on Malaysian employees, expect many services to be disrupted. A couple I talked to have elderly parents to care for and children at home. They brought frozen minced meat to cook porridge for their elderly parents, packs of cereal for their kids, some canned food, eggs and spices. They share with me their concerns on how many food services are reliant solely on Malaysian exports, and how this poses a lot of uncertainty on them being able to buy takeout food in the future (even if there is Singaporean workers around). Obviously their parents shouldn't eat fast food, that's why they are buying minced meat now. 

**Some of the people in the queue are Malaysians. Yes the Covid-19 situation gave us a reverse Uno card** (person in front of me in the queue)

From what I heard, supermakets in Malaysia are completely wiped off and wet markets are selling the vegetables at ridiculously high prices. In face of the coming lockdown, Malaysians NEED to stock up on food. So some of them recruited the help of their Malaysian friends/relatives to buy food for them in Singapore to be brought back into Malaysia. Instead of Singaporeans going to Johore for groceries, Malaysians are now in the queue to buy food to be brought back into Malaysia. Goes to show how bad the situation is.    

Another thing I heard was the criticism of Minister Chua Chan Sing for being out of touch. It was said that since he doesn't go for grocery shopping himself, and would stay safe in the event of crazy inflation (it is def on the tables now seeing how many countries are going on lockdown with the economy crashing around us), he doesn't understand why would Singaporeans panic buy now. Yes, we have prepared for the event that there's supplies disruption from Malaysia, but what if everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in? I do feel for the couple and their elderly parents. 

**Personal thoughts**

Some people have legitimate reasons for buying. Like the Malaysian in front of me, and the couple behind me. I may sound like the unreasonable person here....but I buy (just enough for me, not carts full) because I am afraid that if I go shopping tonight there would be no more eggs or oil left for me. I hope everyone gains a clearer understanding about the second wave of panic buying now.",2020-03-17 18:03:33,"

As long as what you are doing is justifiable and not reacting due to irrationale fear and panic then its all good. Seems like u felt insecure & wants to justify ur actions.

You want to stock up and hoard, it's perfectly fine to me. But if you do one of the following:

1. Complain about slow service & long queues/ leaving the trolleys & baskets in one corner, expecting poor aunties to put back for you
2. Complain how much you bought/eaten the same food over and over again in my face
3. Reselling at a high price

You can expect to earn my middle finger

=== Author: CrossfittJesus===
One of the things that companies always do (or rather, should have already done ages ago) is the idea of *contingency planning*. Basically, like your BCP - what to do when crisis hits, when your building is bombed, when there is a national disease outbreak, etc. etc. For the NSmen out there, I'm sure you know what I mean - we do exercises because we envisage all scenarios and how we react. Those who are involved with the HQ type of planning (e.g. S2-S4), know that the HQ always plans for every time of scenario so that there are drawer plans for them.

I'm sure the good people at MTI have long thought of the many contingencies that Singapore can face, and how to prepare for that. Things like, what if water from Malaysia is suddenly cut off, what if water is polluted, etc etc., and I'm 100% sure food supply from Malaysia is one of them. Imo, the seriously underrated sentiment now is that we really have been planning for this, and there is ample supply. Yes, I know its human psyche to go out and hoard like crazy, but spare a thought for the people who really need it.

CLOWN

=== Author: HedonisticSwine===
Let me respond to all of your points. They are, if true, definitely very legitimate concerns. But this predicate on them being true. 

(1) I assume by ""food service"", you are solely referring to them as frontline workers who sells cooked food (if you are referring to it as their involvement in our food supplies, see next point). While I do not have the data, I'd believe that there is a good mix of food services offered by people of various nationality in Singapore. Nonetheless, suppose I am wrong, it still does not justify for panic buying since the reduction in food services does not have any impact on our food supplies (again, see next point). 

(2) I really wish you would provide more concrete evidence that Singapore is solely reliant on Malaysia for food export. I highly doubt that any 1st-world government will be so unwise as to place all their dependency on one country for their essential needs. I'd, instead, rather believe that this is a bunch of hearsay which a bunch of boomers, with their vast experience theorizing conspiracies, have you believe. 

(3) Agree that the elderly shouldn't eat fast-food, if possible. But suppose we are truly at a stage of food shortage, who gives a shit about what anyone eats so long as it is food? Even if we are still compassionate when we reach that stage, how long can you keep the minced meat fresh? Longer than the food shortage is going to be here? If no, I really don't see why this line of reason justifies panic buying. 

(4) So what if those that are buying the food are Malaysians? I'd argue that a little kindness towards our neighboring country in this time is not bad diplomacy strategy. Besides, it is probably a one-off incident for people like this since they will be bringing the food back and wouldn't be allowed to come back in the near future. You might argue that they will deliver the food back through other means and continue staying in SG. Well, chances are this is not a majority of them and if they are, I'm sure our the government will step-in in due time to curb this problem. It is not a justification for Singaporeans to panic buy! If anything, we should be ""whistleblowing"" such people to the authorities so that they will intervene. 

(5) With regard to CCS being out-of-touch, please back up this claim because it seems like another sweeping statement boomers have you believe. 

(6) But even IF this is true (which is a big IF), please note the fallacy in the argument that CCS doesn't grocery shop and therefore we need to panic buy. So what if he is out-of-touch with grocery shopping? Does it mean there will be insufficient food for Singaporeans because he doesn't know what's in our NTUC? Heck, he is probably one of the few who actually saw how much food we have left physically in our food reserves! So even if he doesn't know what grocery shopping is like anymore, it really is NOT a legitimate reason to panic buy; if CCS doesn't know how much food we have in our reserves, then it is time to panic buy! 

(7) Let's consider a bigger IF that you raise, ""everything happens at once with all the countries we are involved in"". Please lah, this is a pandemic, not an apocalypse! It is not everyone for themselves, every countries for themselves. Furthermore, we have enough food to last Singaporeans at least 3 months. And in the case that it really does become somewhat of an apocalypse, I kid you not that if you have food supplies, you ain't gonna get away with not being hijacked/robbed. After all, that world would be a lawless one. 

You might say I am naive for trusting our government, but I am sure as hell proud of what our government has done so far with the virus that I am willing to cooperate with them in moving our society — as a whole — forward. I truly believe that if Singapore can't do it, no one can. So please stop sowing uncertainties in our society by fallaciously passing them off as ""legitimate"" reasons. Singapore government invest money into the education system in hopes that we will all learn to think logically, so please don't let their investments go to waste. To quote LHL, ""This is SG United, we are SG United"". 

P.S. I really hope this comment will age well....

If you see old person with basket of only few items please let them go in front of you to pay. Physically they may not be able to stand so long, not everyone have money to stock up food and not everyone have someone able to shop for them.

I actually kinda agree a little with the comment, especially after my encounter with the couple I met last night. They look super stressed and sleep deprived. All they want to do is to care for their parents and CCS doesn't seem to understand why Singaporeans buy, lumping everyone all together in the category of ""Xia-suay"".

=== Author: danielling1981===
Let me put it this way.

If you see someone doing something due to their lack of knowledge or ignorance over things that are seemingly normal and not too hard to understand. 

What might you call these people? Silly. Like this also dunno. Xia suay, etc.

So merging with this context. People hoarding due to their possibility mistaken beliefs, understanding. 

What do you call these people?

One of them is a nurse - This is scary. 

Another Indonesian who had symptoms coming over to Singapore, really? This means that Indonesian Gov is not doing enough testing, how can their numbers be so low when already 3 came to Sg to seek treatment?

=== Author: tenbre===
I hope you people realize that SG medical sector has  ALOT of rich indonesians who come here for medical treatment routinely. It's very big business for the private hospitals and clinics. 

But of course I'm also against them spreading covid here, should ban them from doing that.

=== Author: evilplushie===
Another Indonesian national travelled here while sick to get treatment here. 
Time to do something about this

=== Author: redwithin===
By this point any travel history could make someone suspect.

Ironically the places one is least likely to be infected at now are probably Hong Kong, Taiwan and China outside of Hubei.

=== Author: Klubeht===
At least the no. In ICU dropped to 9 from 12...but still, this is gonna be a new norm I fear. At least another month or so most likely

=== Author: danorcs===
I think for tourists coming from countries that have community spread it would be wise to at least require a doctor’s certified clearance to fly before boarding to Singapore. 

There is a real risk of locals on the flights getting infected from tourists deliberately flying to seek treatment. 

I was on a flight to Japan which had to be delayed because a passenger who was not medically cleared to fly insisted on boarding, and eventually had to be escorted out, after other passengers threatened to leave the plane if she stayed onboard.

Thanks to case 163 (boulder+ cluster) who visited climb central funan, I’m now under quarantine for the next 2 weeks along with everyone who went there on Sunday. Major disruptions in my life. Had to reschedule a major surgery and I won’t even know when I can have it now.

=== Author: akillergx===

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Curious, what would an airline do if a sick person wishes to board their plane?

=== Author: Pandacius===
I think at this point, we need to update our quanrantine policies. US, and most european nations have become hotspots - with far more people infected/population than CHina when we blocked China. As such, we need to force all visitors from these countries to go on a 14 day quanrantine in SG. Same goes for our neighbours who don't report (e.g. Phillipines, Indonesia)

China actually has the virus controlled outside Wuhan, and we can probably allow them back in.

=== Author: Swiftdancer===
>Case 176 is an imported case involving a 37 year-old female British national who had been in Japan from 24 February to 4 March, and the UK from 4 March to 8 March. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 11 March morning, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

Can't help but find it strange that this British national went to Japan, then flew to the UK and finally flew to Singapore. If she was just sightseeing, won't it have made more sense to fly from Japan to Singapore? Normally, I wouldn't think too deeply about this, but since we've had three Indonesians who deliberately come here for treatment, was she also thinking of getting treatment here too?

=== Author: chenhankiang===
It's easy to highlight the imported cases. But there are 10 more cases local transmitted that still cannot be traced.

Case 170 is a family member of Case 152, the Indonesian guy who fell sick in Indonesia, sought treatment and then decided to fly over here for treatment. I'm surprised they flew on separate days, since 170 arrived on 9 March, while he came on the 7 March.

=== Author: evilplushie===
It's fucked up is what it is.  Endangering people on the flight. We should turn them back

We need to close our borders to Indonesia/Thailand/Phillipines. These places are all hotspots now that don't do testing...

=== Author: Happyygirl===
Already told you that making them pay for treatment is not a deterrent, it's just a nice sounding policy to make it seem like the PAP is doing something. 

Firstly there is no way to force them to pay. Once they get themselves here we basically have no choice but to treat them for free.

Secondly, even if the rich ones do pay, they take up our valuable hospital resources meant for us.

This isn't well thought out of at all.

I think gov should just have a law - all those who have shown symptoms in their home countries will be sent home without treatment, cos tbh all those rich people probably wouldn't mind paying to get treatment in sg. 

But they are taking up medical resources in this period and putting those flying with them at risk. This is no-no

=== Author: beyondridiculous===
I want that to happen too, unfortunately my dad works in indo. He usually travels in on fridays and out on weekends, to make what little time he has to see his family. Due to the outbreak, I've told him to stay in indonesia atm. It's safer for him (less travelling), and his work requires him to be there most of the time. So if borders shut out indonesia, I hope there is a way to bring my dad back. As much as he is familiar there, he is still a citizen of SG. It would fare better for him if he was here, not mentioning the health issues that he has.

=== Author: maolyx===

It's actually not mandatory by law to wear a mask in either Hong Kong or Taiwan, and only mandatory in a few provinces in China.

Edit: Just to add, Taiwan's advice on masks is actually similar to Singapore's. One main difference, however, is they've been able to give out more masks (2 per week) to citizens since they have local mask production capabilities and have banned exports.

=== Author: redwithin===
You'll be surprised.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3893582

The entire point being that this is nothing to do with how well Taiwan and Hong Kong have been dealing with the virus, and everything to do with countries' impressions and the association with China.

=== Author: redwithin===
Why would they do that? 

They've already found out that it's impossible to keep this under wraps, and they've taken pretty draconian measures to keep it under control.

Could be. I'm probably just overthinking this, but I learnt yesterday of a Vietnamese London resident who had to specially fly via private jet from London to Vietnam to get tested because the hospital wouldn't test her for Covid 19 despite her being sick and having contact with a confirmed patient, so I can't help but wonder whether Case 176 flew here to get tested, or if it were just a coincidence.

I definitely hope so, but it seems unlikely from the complete statement (parent comment had the other two paragraphs).

At any rate, one day is short enough that I wouldn't blame her too much. ""Onset of symptoms"" is awfully difficult to identify accurately. I just fell sick and got a 5-day MC, but honestly unless it hits you really hard immediately, it's hard to place exactly when you feel symptoms except in hindsight.

=== Author: Djsuria===
Yeah but remember - people can still spread it while not having any symptoms

=== Author: tenbre===
True. Although even if not free, i believe that many of them will still pay for treatment here. Compared to no testing, no treatment in Indonesia. There are rich folks in our neighbouring countries who can afford it.

=== Author: omnia-mutantur===
precisely. Case 152 had already visited a hospital in Indonesia, went straight to SGH upon arrival here. probably then told 170 that ""eh, its ok Singapore will take us in, just need to pay""

and dont forget case 147. already had symptoms back in Indonesia - flew into Seletar Airport, and went to his rented apartment at Oxley Road. now, i dont think the indonesia budget airlines fly to Seletar Airport (afaik its just Firefly from Malaysia) so......yeah. 

they are really just exploiting the generosity and quality of our healthcare system.

=== Author: evilplushie===
They're coming here because their govt refuses to diagnose them. But enough is enough,  their behaviour is selfish and endangers people on the plane and locals.  

We really should do what thailand is doing and require doctor letters giving a clean bill of health for indonesians who want to travel here at this time.

=== Author: swordbearerb1===

=== Author: evilplushie===
Then they'll just lie they didn't see doctors back home. We need to make them provide a doctors letter to say they're ok before they come over so if they're lying, we can just lock them up and deport them

=== Author: DasBiceps===
So we should send them home when they're already symptomatic? What about all the other people who are going to share their flight home with them?

Nice idea though.

I think by borders it would be same as what we did for China. That is, ban those entering on tourist visas. Allow long-term pass holders/Pr/citizens to come back, but enforced a 14 day stay at home notice.

The government did a good job in encouraging their local producers to expand production line and agreed to purchase all mask they produce and do the work for distribution via local pharmacy in the country. 

This helped them smooth out the mask shortage a lot, plus with their Medicare system, it ensures everyone is only able to purchase that quantity of mask. 

Although the burden of labour falls on the pharmacy now to pack and sell the mask, leading to long queues at most places, it's still much better than many places now where people can't get mask and people who hoarded earlier on are ripping people off via resale platform onlines.

=== Author: Elephant789===

Asymptomatic transmission has not been concretely proven. What is more likely is that some of the symptoms are so mild that people don't even realise they have symptoms.

If they’re well connected and can fly in on private jets, do you think that letter will be difficult for them to obtain?

If you have all the money in the world, would you want to be treated in Singapore or Indonesia? Keep in mind, you probably can't be treated for the virus if they refuse to test you for it for whatever reasons. If its a political reason, then all the connections and money means nothing. You need power.

>If you're well connected, you can get local govt to get hospitals to test you

I mean you can say that and I can say if you are rich enough, you can also get the local govt to test you. There is no way for either of us to  prove who is right or wrong.

=== Author: mrmeowman===
Nah. The rich do prefer to come to Singapore for their treatments anyway. I’m just saying that the bureaucratic step of getting a letter is nothing to these people cos they’re determined to be treated anyway.

=== Author: evilplushie===
Well, speaking from personal experience I've known rich people who aren't well connected and I've known rich people who regularly meet and dine with govt officials.  

I think even if you're rich, if you suddenly approach a govt official to throw money at them,  they may not accept such a sudden bribe

=== Author: raymmm===
>if you suddenly approach a govt official to throw money at them,  they may not accept such a sudden bribe

So throwing unlimited money may not move an govt official but in your opinion being well connected will DEFINITELY do the trick? Like I said, we are talking about hypothetical. But in actuality, the only sure way to get tested for sure is not being well connected or rich. It is being in power.

=== Author: evilplushie===
If you regularly wine and dine government officials, they're more likely to do favors for you because they know you and trust you.  If a stranger suddenly comes up to you and promises to give you a million dollars to do something you're not supposed to, are you going to believe him

Word on the ground that I heard was March initially, and I also heard May as a back up (this was news I heard back in Dec/January before COVID hit SG). May might still be possible if COVID clears up soon, but that being said I really do think the virus will drag out to the end of the year thanks to the massive numbers of cases in Europe/US atm so it will likely be later. 

Also lots of problems with online votes, and a waste of crucial manpower at such a time tbh.

There’s a possibility they’ll pass extraordinary measures to delay the election past April 2021. While to me that’s more likely than building an online voting system from the ground up, I also think it isn’t a good precedent to set. In a country where many democratic norms are already eroded, it’s better if we stick to at least this deadline.

I wonder if there’s scope for a more diffused voting system. Create a one-month voting period, keep the voting stations open longer each day, compel people to come at allocated times. It would minimize congestion. Could also heavily encourage early mail-in voting if that’s a thing. All better than creating an e-voting system or delaying election, I think.

However, during the meal, one of the few items is not brought out. The menu has also completely changed to a few more limited items. At that point I also realised they change the T&C of the vouchers!

Best part is, I actually have screenshots of the voucher t&c and the voucher t&c after they changed. The T&C was changed even when the voucher is already in my “wallet” and paid for.

I emailed in to the Reservation App’s company and they said that due to COVID, the menu change. After much back and forth and as I consumed the mea, they willing to refund half.

At the point of emailing, the reservation app is still promoting the restaurant with the older and larger menu.

So now, I am fighting with the Res App company on a refund. I totally feel it’s damn fraudulent.

=== Author: Nerac74===
There might Not be a definite right or wrong side,  most likely a mixed zones.  It definitely is dependent on a few possibilities.  This Is a personal opinion. 

1)how long ago did you purchase the voucher ?  was it bought a long time before covid 19 appears or was it just after covid 19 becomes closer to being a pandemic? 

2) If certain ingredients are indeed from the covid impacted places,  and if there's no other suitable sources for the sane ingredients,  then they ""might "" be able not to serve you and change it BUT they should have informed you about the change when you use your voucher to claim the meal   .

And offer you options like to proceed with the meal but with a new dish replacing that unavailable dish,  or maybe even giving u a partial discount for the meal while you still eat the meal,  or maybe if their management allows a full refund without the meal being claimed

Also I'm sure some people might not want to eat food being imported from those areas fearing virus traces and such lor 

3) for refunds wise,  How many dishes is included in the vouchern. If you are entitled to 5 dishes but only 1 dish is affected and they are allowing to change to another dish and even refund you 50% , I don't think you lose out. Unless u super die hard wanted to eat that dish lor

4) for them to use the same menu as advert is definitely a bad choice,  they should either update the listing.  This is a definite fail on their part.

So my husband's company actually penalizes people by cutting their bonuses if they take more than 5 days MC, (it's a government linked company btw).

So in a case like this, obviously people will turn up sick to work because they don't want to lose out on their full bonus, plus a bulk of them are not highly paid. Would this be socially irresponsible? I think there are some grey areas especially when it comes to turning up sick to work.

At some point we're really going to need to have a national conversation about the culture that contributes to this socially irresponsible behaviour. And it's not going to be a PC conversation, but for the sake of our collective sanity (and clearly our health...), it's a conversation that needs to be had. We live in a country that loves touting its non-PC-ness, so here goes nothing - why is it that when the public freakout over the virus was at its worst, with all the obscene hoarding going on, the Malay and Indian communities were relatively placid and chill (not really partaking in the hoarding)? Why is it that compliance seems to be high from them (avoidance of gatherings and hoarding)? Why is it that these demographics are hardly the ones running afoul of basic decorum in a pandemic? What are the cultural differences that contribute to these variances in behaviour?

> Hundreds are affected.

This is an exaggeration. Lots of these carriers have been walking around malls, casinos and more. If that would affect hundreds, we would have thousands of cases by now. 

The fact that the bulk of local cases falls within 3 large clusters indicates that, as has always been suggested, transmission is mostly through close contact. This is also true overseas as well (half the cases in South Korea being linked back to the cult shows that contact can be traced all the way to the source) 

This doesn't mean that it's OK to go out when sick, as even infecting one more person is one too many. But the idea that one rogue patient is going to infect a ton of people simply isn't true.

Well if they were to tell people that covid is getting serious, guess the supermarkets are going to be emptied again by those idiots.

=== Author: runebound2===
Complete conjecture, but I believe the posture of the government is always changing and dependent on the seriousness of Covid-19 in Singapore. That is to say, they have prepared for the very worst but they will only evoke the very worst if the situation demands for it.

To suspend every event out there would signal that the situation is very bad (when it might not be). For example, cancelling the air show or in Italy right now, the cancellation of all sporting events. This screams, the situation is bad, pleased don't go out and stay home. Going outside to mingle is dangerous. 

However, this in turn can have a knock on effect. We've seen people mass buying and hoarding. But I think to the concern of the govt is the absolute pummeling such actions will have on the economy. LHL is already urging people to go for staycations and to attend local attractions. They want citizens to keep spending, to keep the Singapore economy chugging along. Cancelling all events may be a death kneel to the economy

Hence the extent of the govt is based on various factors. If more and more cases continue to appear and deaths start trickling in, then I won't be surprised if the govt provides a blanket ban on events

=== Author: DuhMightyBeanz===

Well, last Saturday, my cousin's BMT POP went ahead as per normal other than travel declaration and thermal scanners. So no, as what the government says, life must go on.

Many grassroots and government mass gathering activities are still ongoing. Last weekend, PAP women's wing gathered as well. The government must practice what they preach.

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
That is why some countries choose to do a full lockdown or cancel mass gatherings (such as schools being canceled in Japan). 

You can't prevent 100% of cases but if you prevent enough it will prevent the hospitals from being overloaded. This will prevent deaths. 

Also, the sooner you get medical attention when sick the better your chances of surviving. Escaping quarantine or delaying medical treatment will just increase your risk of severe infection and even death. 

Just because we can't make it 100% doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

Social responsibility should be the duty of every person. 

The government can of course choose to assume everyone will not be responsible and push extreme measures to prevent all sorts of mass gatherings, enact laws to make it a criminal offence to make false declaration, etc. Such measures can potentially encroach on our freedom if it is extreme enough. The government can also give our society the freedom of responsibility instead of mandating it on us.

Give us the choice to be responsible = naive?
Enforce extreme measures on us assuming everyone is irresponsible does not sound too good either.

The difficult thing is balancing between the two.

Yes because they still have symptoms and now we know its justified

=== Author: 557088===
I can't remember the exact number but I think there was like 40k+ people diagnosed with ""flu"". I don't think we can test this many.

=== Author: Dat_mechafanboy===
U're being disingenuous, there are multiple cases where the infected had to make multiple trips to the clinics or hospitals before they would be tested. If a person have flu and running fever for days, they ought to be checked, not kicked around like a political football.

=== Author: zed_j===
Yes why not? Korea is doing that

=== Author: luminoir===
Well we are missing data on people who have it but aren't tested because of mild symptoms/recovery/rejected for testing. What is needed is random sampling across a distribution of locations, not just suspected cases to get an idea of how many asymptomatic carriers there are, in a process akin to straw polling.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2002125

""A key point of these recommendations is that viral testing should not be used only for clinical care. A proportion of testing capacity must be reserved to support public health efforts to characterize the trajectory and severity of the disease. Although this approach may result in many negative test results and therefore appear “wasteful,” such set-aside capacity will permit a far clearer understanding of the spread of the epidemic and wiser use of resources to combat it. Testing in unexplained clusters or severe cases of acute respiratory infections, regardless of a patient’s travel history, may be a sensitive way to screen for chains of transmission that may have been missed. Such findings are relevant particularly in light of evidence that even Singapore, with one of the world’s best public health systems, has found cases that have so far not been linked to known cases or to Chinese travel. If such undetected introductions are happening in Singapore, it is prudent to expect they are happening elsewhere as well.""

Until something like this is done, we are only testing symptomatic cases which are by definition the parts of the iceberg over the water.

Yes of course its best for any confirmed case to be isolated as soon as possible (and for their close contacts to be quarantined).

However the impression that a single loose cannon will immediately infect hundreds of people is far from true. 

The evidence in Singapore and South Korea (two of the few places where proper contact tracing seems to have been done) does show that infection is mostly through close contact and not casual contact.

=== Author: redwithin===
As I recall, there was no correlation between those who caught the virus and where they sat on the bus. 

It could also be used as evidence that sitting right in front of and next to a confirmed case doesn't mean that you'll catch the virus as well. Which is precisely the point I'm trying to make here - walking through a mall when confirmed isn't going to make hundreds infected.

Additionally, I remember another observation on that study was that it could have been equally likely that the two who caught it had already caught the virus before boarding the bus, given how widespread the virus was in China.

Again, let me emphasise - this does not mean it's OK for confirmed (or even suspect) cases to go out. One more person infected is one too many. But it's still an exaggeration to say that one loose person is going to get hundreds of people infected.

=== Author: redwithin===
The context here is infecting people by walking through a mall, and not by refusing testing, escaping from hospitals and engaging your whole cult to infect the city.

You go to the same doctor so that doctors can keep track of symptom progression. We're not going to test everyone who shows up at a clinic with sore throat, and that's often the first symptom to present, so needing at least 2 visits isn't surprising at all.

=== Author: redwithin===
In every reply I've made, I've acknowledged that casual transmission can happen. It just happens at a much, much lower rate of transmission than close contact transmission. Ergo, it is statistically impossible that casual transmission can result in hundreds of cases appearing because a single person went to a mall. Or a bus. or a train.

Read back to my original reply. Singapore and South Korea are good examples because the vast majority of cases are traceable, especially in South Korea where more than half the cases were traceable to Shincheonji. Very few cases are untraceable, and even then this doesn't mean that it wasn't spread through a close contact but was spread casually.

In summary - single case of casual transmission? Possible, but unlikely. Mass case of casual transmission? Extremely unlikely to the point of impossibility.

=== Author: krnrd===
Well, mentality is a mindset while psychology is how a human mind behaves. In times of crises, psychology (humans basic instinct) will kick in and rule over mindset.

Brilliant circuit. Huge for a karting circuit with lots of well radiused corners. Also much cheaper to boot. Their race karts are cheaper per session than the baby karts in Sg.

Avid F1 fan, now that the season is on hold. You can put me on the list!

=== Author: Meatseeker===
Hey there, seconding the idea of Permas Karting in JB. It's a really good technical and full sized track with multiple configurations, they have race weekends and championships where they change the layout and you get to experience new tracks over the season. Started going there about 3 years ago after I found the Singapore tracks a bit too small for my liking. 

I bought a private racing kart there that haven't been used much lately, 2 stroke rotax engine and intrepid frame if you are familiar. Other hobbies got in the way, but always thought about sharing it to others who want to get into the sport to try out, kinda wasted just sitting there. Hit me up if you're interested. 

There are some costs that comes along with it mainly racing tires and engine rebuilds, but if you wanna go regularly it's cheaper than renting fun karts, just pay the track fee and you have the whole day to practice. You'll probably want to graduate to race karts after a few fun kart sessions also.

=== Author: uniquely_ad===
Theres not many places to do Karting in SG, but the track at KF1 Kranji is amazing..did the advance Fun kart which requires a driving license..its thrilling

If you're well enough to walk to the nearest PHPC, please do! And like others have commented here, call ahead so they can advise you on how to proceed (or make necessary precautions like clear out the clinic or mask up). I live in an estate with LOTS of elderly people so I'm equally worried about spreading it to the vulnerable and immuno-compromised as I am about catching it myself. 

From what I understand, if the clinic suspects that you're a contender for the virus, you will be picked up in an ambulance and taken straight to NCID. I feel that might be a better option than getting on public transport and self-presenting at the hospital (again, because of the risk of infecting others). London's first case was that of a Chinese woman who took an Uber (!!!) to the hospital and self-presented to A&E hospital staff who weren't wearing masks at close range...

Best to act now rather than wait around until your symptoms worsen. There's still a high chance it could just be a bad flu you're experiencing. Wishing you a speedy recovery either way!

First you think you don't have it. Then you start panicking and getting pissed at the irresponsible bastard that may have transmitted it to you. You then start thinking about quarantining yourself, and for how long
Maybe week. Perhaps 2, to be safe. As your social life falls apart, the monotony overtakes you. Finally, you come to terms with your new life, only to realise you've been fine all this time.


On a serious note, doc will suggest you keep an eye on your health. The moment you start coughing report to NCID immediately.

=== Author: 557088===
Go to the doctor and say that you have been experiencing flu symptoms for very long. Then pretend that you have close contact with confirmed cases and they will test you. Unethical LPT but if you are concerned for yourself, this is the fastest way.

If you have mild symptoms, go gp, tell the gp why you feel like you have Covid. You might have a good reason, but it's medical confidentiality / privacy, you don't have to explain it here. 

If you feel so strongly about it. Like so damn sick + close contact with confirmed case, you could even go to A&E. A&E is $$$, and more waiting time and potentially making a fool of yourself and also getting closer to other Covid patients. 

If you are asking medical advice on Reddit, that means you aren't sure, which means you should go to the gp and let the medical professional advice you.
The visits are subsided to $10 now anyway.

-

Aside: locals who have mild symptoms can recover well on their own at home, without requiring hospitalization. And by self isolating if sick + 5 day MC, govt is doing a pseudo quarantine measure. It frees up hospital resources for critical cases.

=== Author: tehtf===
OP are you on phone surveillance or close contact with confirm case? If you have close contact and showing symptoms, but for some reason contact tracing yet to reach you (30+ new cases to trace within 3 days -_-), you may want to call MOH hotline, see if they can link you up with the incharge to explain your situation and let them access if you warrant ambulance to hospital for testing.

If you just showing sysmptoms with no link to any confirm case (yet), you will have to wear mask and go to the HCPC and go though GP accessment then.think symptom + travel history will also put you in high risk group

=== Author: tehtf===
Sorry just curious, then on what basis did they offer you the testing? No travel history, no contact, no symptom. I don’t see any basis for testing

=== Author: CCVork===
>A&E is (...) getting closer to other Covid patients. 

You sound like the A&E is filled with Covid patients. Are Covid suspects actually sent from clinics to wait around in A&E, or do you just mean patients with self diagnosed Covid (like op) tend to check themselves in at A&E (I assumed people would go to PHPC clinic but op post made me rethink it)? Genuine question because it seems like terrible practice, if true, to have covid suspects hang around in A&E where other patients, some with compromised immunity, are waiting to get treated, not catch another virus.

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
I asked if I would be at risk if I were to meet people who travel from Middle East or Africa (for work). 

I was planning to either meet them in person or ask for a conference call. It is always better to meet in person, but I was wondering if I needed to switch to a video call instead.

=== Author: tehtf===
That is why if you highly suspect you have covid (close contact with confirmed case eg.) you directly call MOH hotline to see if they can send ambulance to hospital directly. (May take some time for the arrangement)

If not, when you register at AnE (wear mask), inform the registra about your condition and see if they will put u in an isolation corner and do quick swab test.

If not, they may treat you as normal AnE patient and you wait with other patients at AnE for 3 hrs...u

=== Author: tenbre===
You just read the news releases yourself. How many people directly go to hospital and get admitted, versus the number of people who went to gp/poly on the same day then sent to hospital? Please give me the count.

There are averaging 10 cases per day. They arrive at all the hospitals across SG. That's average one per day at each A&E. You're quite likely to be near one confirmed case if you have symptoms and go A&E any day. Compared to PHPC where there are thousands of clinics. 

What's wrong with potential covid patients hanging around A&E? A&E is like the front door of the hospital, where else are they going to get admitted? Certainly not the specialist clinics. 
All hospitals already have separate outdoor triage area since weeks back, where a fully gowned up staff will take your temperature, history, check for respiratory symptoms etc and then separate you away from other normal patients. In a sense this is a split A&E. 

Until your test results come back, all potential patients might get grouped together as the patient load increases. The further along the epidemic, the more crowded the hospitals, the less you will get isolated. At some point, run out of isolation ward, just throw all into the same ward, if all of you have covid, no need to isolate from each other anyway. 

This is why, if you're not That sick, don't go hospital. Go gp. Stay home and recover, until your symptoms so jialat that you need hospitalization. Since 80% of ppl don't need hospitalization. 

If clinic gp thinks you need to go hospital, they will call an ambulance, you wait and get ferried to hospital. And ambulance drops you off at A&E right? But at least now the gp will tell the ambulance crew what is wrong with you, and the ambulance crew will tell the hospital staff. This is in a professional medical manner, not just random ownself diagnose. 

What did China do? They had dedicated hospitals that only take covid. Because their healthcare infra is structured differently. What did SG do? Mostly sent to NCID, and all major hospitals have isolation wards, full A&E, training etc. Don't go to a shitty private hospital that has no resources to handle covid, you'll just get bumped to a public hospital. 

Anyway it is in the hospital interest that confirmed cases don't spread around. More transmission means much more work for them especially. 

The more important issue to worry about are employers who have their staff work with symptoms and foreigners who come here with symptoms.

=== Author: athoughteternal===
In the present situation, I think there is priority will be to clear these patients first.

=== Author: CCVork===
Then are suspect cases seen at the clinic also sent to wait in the same isolation area directly?

I was at AnE recently accompanying family and didn't see an isolation corner, although had the temperature screening Ofc. Could be that I missed it.

=== Author: CCVork===
Why you so bothered? I'm glad hospital measures meet your standards but I don't have to change my standards to meet yours.
ETA: I'm not even talking about vague potential patients with flu, but ""covid patients"", to quote you. The ones who GP or they themselves have reason to think is highly likely to have covid. 

I already said in another reply. I accompanied family to A&E lately (twice) for non Covid issues, one resulted in hospitalization and the other required drip, if you want to question if it was necessary. Why can't I be concerned if they just casually put my sick family in the same room without any warning or highlighting that there's an isolation corner to steer clear of. I'm sure it's no big deal to you, but I'll keep my own opinion thanks.

=== Author: Happyygirl===
Stay at home and recover with no testing? Keep the numbers down?

=== Author: CCVork===
That had better be the bare minimum they are doing, if they indeed put them in the same waiting area as other patients, which I'm still waiting to hear confirmation on.

=== Author: tehtf===
Different hospital have different set up. But in principal there should be protocol to separate suspected case away with normal patients while waiting for their result.

=== Author: tenbre===
Why are you so worried about this?

=== Author: CCVork===
I guess I assumed they'll be sent to a different room entirely than be put in the same big room with other emergency patients, even if there's some measures for distancing. Limitations, I suppose. At least I don't think there was sneezing or coughing while I was there.

You're not on ""official quarantine"" if you're on MC only. Only people on official quarantine get the basic income.

The hawker would be in way more trouble if he breached official quarantine.

The self-employed folk out there really deserve pity for facing such a hard choice. Of course it's easy to pronounce that the socially-responsible choice is to stay at home, but some people are really living hand-to-mouth and need *some way* to pay the bills.

Say he is a biz owner selling chicken rice. What happens to the 14 day supply of chicken and rice he ordered? Throw away?

Also, govt only pays if you are under quarantine by them. If you have a cough, see a doc and get 5 days MC, you get nothing.

5 days supply and 5 days not working for a hawker is  probably something like 2k losses.

Very well thought out and sensible strategy. We should all do our best to support the measures when they are implemented.

Marquee pricing has always been according to how famous the DJs are. I bought my early bird tickets online at $48 (+ $4 booking fee) and it was about $68 at the door (for ladies with a drink). When W&W came for last year’s NYE, I think early bird tickets were around ~$70. An international DJ is coming next month and early bird tickets are $28 online.

Eikcins,Looking for any insight into Singaporean Aviation Law,0,fixusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fixusk/looking_for_any_insight_into_singaporean_aviation/,5,1584287082.0,"I understand that this may not be the perfect place to ask this, but I was planning to travel to Australia to visit family, and had a flight later this week.  The situation with COVID has led the Australian Government to impose a 14 day quarantine on arrival, which is fine given that I'm visiting to spend time with family.  

What I hope to learn more about, is how this may affect flights back.  I have a flight back to Singapore for mid April, and need to be back in Singapore to start my new year at university in June.  My primary concern is that while I can get to Australia, there is a risk that Airlines may close flights between Australia and Singapore, perhaps due to loss of revenue, leaving me stranded.  

I am of the understanding that if the government is to close borders or flights, there would be a window of time for me to scramble onto a flight back before a flight-ban comes into effect, as seen in the American-Europe situation.  However, if a cancellation of flights is to come from the carriers themselves, ie. SIA, there may be no such window.

Therefore, my question is if anyone has any information regarding the ability of carriers to cancel flights between certain locations.  Frankly, any information or insight regarding flying in these times would be very much appreciated, whether relevant to my problem or not.

Thank you!",2020-03-15 23:44:42,"

Aviation law doesn't cover these situations.

It's public health law.

If you need to make school, stay in Singapore. Advisories are out about non-essential travel.

=== Author: 557088===
Flights to and from china didn't stop even at the height of their outbreak. What makes you think Australia of all places would be the first to have all flights cancelled?

=== Author: smalldog257===
Travel restrictions have got progressively harsher since late January and it's been difficult to predict even a week ahead. The safest thing to do is for everyone to stop non-essential travel.

=== Author: Kwapchap===
Nothing to do with Aviation Laws. It’s a developing crisis and multiple parties are involved - 2 countries, airlines etc. Nobody can under these circumstances can give you any form of assurance.

I’m surprised nobody thought of this earlier, even though it’s common knowledge that elderly people are more vulnerable. Conversely, people were asking for schools to be closed even though it’s well-documented that children recover from it extremely well.

=== Author: Darwinsingh===
Come on man.

=== Author: AsiaThrowaway===
Yeah, 14 days would let some infections show up but wouldn't catch everything. The minister provided an explanation that they wanted to minimize disruption but I personally think that fighting the virus should be our priority. 

Hubei province has been in lockdown since Jan 23rd. 

Tokyo has canceled school till the end of March. 

Italy is in lockdown.

While I think our efforts have been excellent in controlling the spread of the virus thus far, not taking aggressive enough containment measures is a gap that I hope the government isn't overlooking.

=== Author: lmnmss===
Technically there is always an election coming so I guess the govt are always scumbags who does things because an election is coming? /s

=== Author: krnrd===
That’s true, but children are potentially very effective carriers of the virus, especially when there is elderly in the family. 

Granted schools have implemented measures like hand washing during school hours, but I see  children crowd around after school hours playing, queuing up in 711s buying drinks and snacks. 

It takes just one to spread, and knowing that covid is a super spreader, I think it’s justifiable to close schools, at least for a while, or implement measures like reducing school to three days a week or the like.

=== Author: autonomy_girl===
Yes I understand the potential, but the point is, we haven’t seen any evidence of it being spread via schoolchildren yet. And it ultimately goes back to the harm the virus can wreak on the elderly. But nobody thought of actually stopping the actual gatherings of seniors.

we have THREE imported cases from Indonesia. Meanwhile, according to them, everything is well in their country [thanks to blessings from the Almighty](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid19-coronavirus-indonesia-blessing-from-god-12476538)!

&#x200B;

Case 152 is an imported case involving a 65 year-old male Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore on 7 March. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).He reported onset of symptoms on 28 February while he was in Indonesia, and had sought treatment at a hospital in Jakarta on 2 March. He presented at SGH on 7 March. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 8 March afternoon.

Case 153 is likely to be an imported case involving a 65 year-old female Singapore Citizen who had been in Indonesia from 25 February to 28 February. She reported that while she was in Indonesia, she had visited her sister who had pneumonia. She is currently warded in an isolation room at SGH.

Case 147 is an imported case involving a 64 year-old male Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore on 7 March. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.He reported onset of symptoms on 3 March while he was in Indonesia. He had a fever when he arrived at Seletar Airport, and underwent a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint. He was conveyed by ambulance to NCID on 7 March night, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 8 March morning.Prior to hospitalisation, he mostly stayed at his rental apartment in the Oxley Road area.

=== Author: maolyx===
Yes, been seeing lots of new cases of Indonesians coming to seek free treatment. This will cause our health system to be overloaded.

Weren't some already sick while still in Indonesia? Yet they still chose to fly to SG, putting those in the same flight as them at risk. Hope this policy stop these people from flying here.

=== Author: Spinster3838===

And some idiot was suggesting to foreigners to take advantage of our free healthcare on another post. 

Even if they now have to pay, it won't stop people from nearby countries to take advantage of our better healthcare services.

=== Author: PaulS123u===
This thread is toxic, the measure is definitely good as it closes the loophole. For those who think it as heartless please consider the case where people purposely travel to seek healthcare. It will result in an increased chance for the patient to spread their virus when they migrate from point A to point B, regardless of their intention. In that case, the pandemic is harder to curb and more people will suffer.

For those who curse at people who exploit the healthcare in Singapore, please understand that it is only human to try and survive. It is selfish of them to exploit goodwill but also, on the other hand, we understand that the disparity in healthcare standard kind of forces them to be selfish.

Either way, live and let live. Let's be gracious and move on with life.

=== Author: Happyygirl===
How are we going to ensure that they will pay for their treatment anyway? Refuse treatment unless they pay upfront? Kick them to the streets spreading the Corona to everyone?

Sounds like another good sounding policy that isn't well thought out. More details need to be provided for this.

=== Author: Achuapy===
They should waive the cost of treatment for any suspected cases on Costa fortuna although it should be safe

The govt should include a medical tourist tax too on these Indonesians, to further deter them. It's one thing to be vacationing in Sg, then falling sick. Another thing altogether to fly here just to receive better medical treatment if you suspect you have COVID. 
In a pandemic, we have to prioritize our medical resources.

It would be even fairer if the new payment policy applies only to short-term visitors who have been in Singapore for less than, e.g. 14 or 28 days, when they get a positive diagnosis. It would be fairer to visitors who get infected in Singapore after they enter, especially those who were here already before March 7.

=== Author: evilplushie===
I think if people knowingly fly here while sick and get tested positive for covid19, should ban them from entering

=== Author: evilplushie===
Then deported most likely

Now plane ticket very cheap . Depending on locations, it  ranges from SGD 100 - SGD 400. So when a foreigner who dont trust their country healthcare system and is from middle to upper class  , SGD 100 - SGD 400 is a small price to pay. Now having them to pay for treatment, the cost of treatment is probably  SGD 5,000 onwards (depending length of hospitalization/how serious  their illness is), it makes them think twice about coming here to leech on our healthcare system

=== Author: e4gleeye===
I dont know if you realize, but for decades Singapore advertises itself as health tourism destination toward its neighbours. From getting critical patients into a private jet with doctors and nurses on-board straight into a private hospital or simpler procedures done Monday, Orchard shopping Tuesday kind of thing. Those that even look at Singapore as a place to get any treatment done have the money to pay in full. If one looks for good treatment but wants to safe money, they usually go to Penang instead.

=== Author: sevter11===
Agree, you cannot have the Singapore government branding itself as a medical hub and good for medical tourism, and then curse all these people seeking treatment when they come.

A whole bunch of these people probably just came for medical treatment and not really expecting the government to pay for their medical bills anyway.

I think MOH keeps calling it the Safra Jurong cluster just like how the Grand Hyatt cluster is still known as the Hyatt cluster (there appears to be a tendency to name clusters by location - it’s a trend that’s not so apparent because the locations tend to be the same as the organisation).

=== Author: mantism===
On first glance, maybe. But they are short-term visitors, meaning that they aren't going to stay for long. It may be meant to discourage foreigners from coming over to Singapore to take advantage of the free healthcare (while being potentially infectious in the meantime).

Enacting this early will reduce the build up of 'foreigner-imported' cases which can potentially bite us hard in the ass in the future. Not sure what this would mean for the incoming cruise ship, though.

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Don't think they deliberately spread it

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Well, the whole point is deterrence, they can't expect a free payment and may end up getting locked up or get their assets drained if they don't pay up.

=== Author: _Blythe===
So.. what do you think they should be doing? Pay for anyone and everyone who comes here sick? Free healthcare for the world? Before covid19 I’m sure there were foreigners who became sick when they got here. You’re making it seem like this is the first time there are sick foreigners here. They’ve been able to deal with it previously I’m sure they’ll be able to deal with it now.

=== Author: Sproinkerino===
Can you explain why you think so

=== Author: RawOnionRings===
I wouldn't be surprised if there are people from other countries, who suspected themselves to have the virus, fly over to Singapore with the intention of getting diagnosis and treatment for covid-19. 

Considering the high number of cases that have recovered, no death cases and previously there's free treatment cost, many would think that SG is the best country for treatment especially if their home country healthcare is inferior

It's already happening.  From Today:  *Of the imported cases, one is an Indonesian national who had an onset of symptoms while in Jakarta on Feb 28. He sought treatment there on March 2 before arriving in Singapore on March 7.*

=== Author: Calikura===
They have to do it sooner or later as it becomes more prevalent in many more countries, which will inevitably lead to more imported cases. The timing of the decision is smart because it encourages (most sensible) people to think twice about non-essential travel here, without having to impose outright restrictions to entry, which can unduly strain bilateral relations. Whereas making people pay for their own hospital treatment when they fall sick is hardly seen as a diplomatic affront.

While charging helps deter leeching, there will always be some that won't mind paying if it means paying to have a higher probability to live.

=== Author: sevter11===
Agreed. Can't have it both ways. You can't market yourself as a medical hub then reject patients when they come

=== Author: N4ilbyt3r===
Between more resources allocated to our locals who need healthcare and more resources to help those that don't belong here, what would you choose?

Would you welcome them knowing our healthcare workers will soon be taxed and exhausted just dealing with local spread?

More beds and ventilators for them means less for locals.

=== Author: evilplushie===
Would you prefer our own citizens die then.  MoH has already hinted our own resources are finite

=== Author: Syncopat3d===
Some short-term visitors can stay for rather long. E.g. someone may enter Singapore uninfected and then get infected and show symptoms after 2 weeks. Then, because he's afraid to pay expensive medical costs and thinks that he's relatively healthy and resilient against the Wuhan virus because he's young, he avoids getting tested and tries to self-quarantine, which is still not as effective as isolation performed by the professionals, so he may end up spreading the virus even though he himself is relatively fine.

A more nuanced approach would be helpful, not just for the visitors but the public health in Singapore. For example, the new policy could be stipulated to be inapplicable to visitors who have been in Singapore for at least 14 days when they get a positive diagnosis. '14' is just a policy parameter that needs to be properly balanced.

=== Author: sageadam===
Criminal negligence is a thing. But I doubt they should be held accountable to this extent.

=== Author: Happyygirl===
Well that’s the point, how are we going to drain their assets if they don’t bring any over here? How is your deterrence going to work?

Locking up people for falling sick? That’ll be great for our international reputation.

=== Author: Happyygirl===
So we are going to kick the infected to the streets and refuse them treatment if they do not put up a deposit?

Sounds like a great idea to ensure an outbreak here.

=== Author: Happyygirl===

They started their cruise here. Its not like they came Singapore for medical tourism. They came here for legitimate tourism but are ostracised by whats happening back home .

However, if people like these Indonesians are rich, they would rather pay for healthcare they can trust (Singapore) as opposed to the healthcare in their home country. So money is no issue to them.

Although it's not mentioned in the article, I believe they're referring to new cases. They have to do this because Malaysia and Indonesia are starting to have more cases surfacing. They want to prevent them from coming to Singapore to seek treatment.

Also, if you treat current cases and send them home, the whole world will hold you in high regards. You don't treat them and deport them, not only you won't get the treatment fees, it will put you in a bad light. I doubt our government is that stupid.

**False dilemma**

A false dilemma (or sometimes called false dichotomy) is a type of informal fallacy in which a statement falsely claims an ""either/or"" situation, when in fact there is at least one additional logically valid option.The false dilemma fallacy can also arise simply by accidental omission of additional options rather than by deliberate deception. For example, ""Stacey spoke out against capitalism, therefore she must be a communist"" (she may be neither capitalist nor communist, or a capitalist who disagrees with portions of capitalism). ""Roger opposed an atheistic argument against Christianity, so he must be a Christian"" (When it's assumed the opposition by itself means he's a Christian). Roger might be an atheist who disagrees with the logic of some particular argument against Christianity.

We have 300 beds in ncid. That's our best containment center for infectious disease. So yeah several hundred people would fill up our best containment. Can we put them in other hospitals? Yes, but then you have to change procedures for entire hospital to ensure the virus is contained or you'll end up like sgh and this will take up more resources. 

Keep in mind there are still other people in hospitals who are there for other reasons than just covid19. The hospitals aren't empty resources just waiting to be used.

So, 63% is my hope, really. I don't think there's enough anger like GE2011, but we aren't in 2015 too. The regression is expected and there seems to be a thought of whoever runs it will still run it ok.

So, the areas I cited are already deemed very competitive. Here's my breakdown.

East Coast is WP's key target GRC. WP has put in much resources that they about match the PAP (+PA) in activities held there. NCMPs from the area have done well, with Leon Perera a particular standout. Plus there is a chance of getting Nicole Seah, a co-star catch of WP's, on board there. PAP also has 2 retirements (Lim Swee Say and Lee Yi Shyan). Right now it is led by Senior Minister of State Maliki Osman but he isn't any firebrand cabinet Minister. Jessica Tan is a typical PAP backbencher so...yeah. Unremarkable. I rate this race a 50/50 tossup.

Sengkang is WP's stretch goal. It has taken Punggol East, a sticky spot for the PAP in the past and where Lee Lilian has remained active there, plus parts of Sengkang West, where Koh Choon Yong did reasonably too. It is likely that one of WP's co-star catch for 2020, Jamus Lim, will be fielded there too given his activity. In addition, there is a lack of an anchor minister there. SMS Lam Pin Min is seen to be leading this fight, but he has messed up many areas before, most recently being the face of the PMD issue so he is not what we can call the most competent PAP guy. Incumbent PE MP and thorn-in-WP's side Charles Chong is also expected to retire so Sengkang will be hotly contested for sure. Teo Ser Luck, once seen as a rising star, is now relegated to being a part of the PAP backbench and is widely expected to step down. This will depend on the actual Minister coming in to anchor the ground, but this is a 55/45 to the PAP now. There's a puncher's chance by WP here regardless.

West Coast is where Ayer Rajah sits. And Ayer Rajah is PSP Sec-Gen's Tan Cheng Bock's old ward where he did win by record figures before albeit under the PAP banner. However, his personal brand has made a traditional PAP heartland a tossup and there is enough 'elites' in his team to overcome that, like his Asst Sec-Gen Leong Mun Wai and Assistant Treasurer and Policy Team lead Hazel Poa. The PAP slate is weakened as while S Iswaran co-leads the West Coast slate, long-time former Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang is expected to step down. Patrick Tay is relatively popular as a rising star and is seen as a potential 5G leader, but Foo Mee Har has not won many hearts in Ayer Rajah. The additional areas include parts of Hong Kah North under SMS for Health Amy Khor and backbencher Yee Chia Hsing so they are PAP heartlands. This is a 50/50 tossup as well given Tan Cheng Bock's personal brand and the LHY factor.

Prediction is for elections within next 2-3 months. Winning 70%, parliament dominance 90%.

I believe political ambitions will be prioritized over the safety of the people. 

They would have been preparing for these elections for at least 2 years as it's transitional leadership. The economy will only turn worse the longer the delay. Election goodies were already handed out during the budget speech. Nothing left to announce if they delay till next year.

If we analyse the situation logically, PAP will still win overwhelmingly regardless its held soon or next year. There is no need to be so insecure or kiasu.

So I really hope the government don't xiasuay and prove me right by ignoring the safety of the people.
. 
. 
. 
Edit: I'm even more certain now after reading LHL speech. He gave two options, to delay or hold it soon. He gave several reasons for holding it soon and ignored the delay option completely after mentioning it.

=== Author: ongcs===
Any other GRC now that has more than one anchor minister?

=== Author: nixhomunculus===
Again, the key question is who can effectively move and defend them vulnerable GRCs. 

Nee Soon GRC? The new boundaries include Education Minister Ong Ye Kung and Law Minister K Shan. However Ong Ye Kung has lost one against WP. Dare he risk it again?

Jurong GRC? Desmond Lee and Tharman won in a PAP heartland but can Desmond Lee translate his success under Tharman to a hostile east?

Tampines GRC? MEWR Minister Masagos with DPM Heng. Masagos could well move but would his malay support translate in East Coast for instance?

=== Author: ongcs===
Maybe Shan or Tharman moves instead?

=== Author: nixhomunculus===
Tharman will be a good move, but he did mention in a April 2019 FB post commenting on the cabinet moves that he will look forward to serving Jurong residents.

K Shan is so firmly entrenched in Nee Soon but it is seen as safe. Nee Soon has been the frontier GRC that WP challenges in. They are for the up-and-coming folks. So he moving is still possible, but dare he move to potentially lose?

They departed from Singapore. So they came back. No news here. And there is way more than 64 Italians

=== Author: orange_blazer===

=== Author: AnfieldSpy===
For god’s sake, please run the COVID swab test on every single passenger. Relying on temperature screening is just like relying on your free AVG antivirus software.

=== Author: redwithin===
The last place the ship docked at was Singapore. It would be a bit of a stretch to do a reverse Hotel California and inform that they can leave but can't come back in.

Malaysia and Thailand did not allow the ships not because of confirmed or even suspected cases, but because Thailand has a restriction on individuals who have been in Italy in the past 14 days, and Malaysia has a new blanket ban on cruise ships.

It would be very weird to have a group of passengers who left Singapore a week ago not be allowed to come back in despite not being exposed to new sources of infection. We should still treat them with the same diligence we would for any passengers who wish to enter Singapore, but not more so just because they were on a cruise ship *that departed from Singapore and was not allowed to dock anywhere else.*

Clearly Diamond Princess, Westerham and Grand Princess are at the top of everyone's minds, but getting on board a cruise ship does not automatically make someone infected. 

There's a difference between accepting a cruise ship that comes straight from an infected area, and another that came from your own port.

Edit: On top of this I'm sure there are a large number of Singaporeans on board the ship as well. We are definitely not going to be turning them away.

=== Author: delulytric===
Should dock them in an offshore island to quarantine them like in St John island. Pretty sure they'll take their chances off an island with impromptu but good medical facilities rather than being stuck in the cruise ship like we have seen in Yokohama's Diamond Princess cruise ship incident.

=== Author: Durian881===
My main concern are the 64 Italians that recently traveled from Italy, a place with more cases and deaths than entire Asia ex-China and ex-Korea. With long incubation period, the ship could be a floating petri dish.

Hope the terminal operator and ship's doctor will do a much better job than SAFRA Jurong in identifying passengers with respiratory symptoms to do swab tests. It'll be tough though as anyone can take medication to hide fever, cough and running nose.

=== Author: LongkangPanda===
This feels as ominous as that scene in Lost World where the ship quietly crashes into New York and all hell broke loose.

=== Author: Angelbones1===
We hope that nobody has caught the Coronavirus in the cruise ship.  Problem is there could be some who are asymptotic, so monitoring for fever is kinda useless.  Not sure how reliable is the nose swabs. Perhaps someone can verify. Fingers crossed that all will end well.

Glad that Singapore is making the right move and not leaving them to die.

=== Author: N4ilbyt3r===
I'm just concern if we are even doing the right thing. 

Will we eventually reach a situation whereby people with pre-existing conditions or emergency situations become neglected (die or health worsen) when our healthcare system is overwhelmed and overburdened with attention on more and more covid 19 cases? Can our healthcare even cope with more community spread in the next few weeks to come and still handle cases on board this ship (chances seem very likely). Worse will be they moving around Singapore thinking they don't have it but carrying it and spreading. Are we digging our graves?

I think they don't plan to test for asymptomatic infections, per extract below. Not very wise given all the literature out there about the virus being infectious before symptoms are seen...

&#x200B;

*Before disembarking, passengers and crew members will be checked by  the doctor on board the ship to ensure they are healthy, said MPA and  STB.*

*""All passengers entering Singapore are required to undergo  temperature screening as a precautionary measure,"" the media release  added.* 

*""Additionally, passengers entering Singapore and  exhibiting fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness but who do  not meet the Ministry of Health’s clinical definition may be required  to undergo a COVID-19 swab test.""*

Even if they last docked at Singapore, 1 week ago means that if anyone on the cruise had the virus but was asymptomatic when they boarded, the virus had 1 week to spread around passengers, especially given how easily the virus seems to spread in cruise ships.  

It's a tough decision. I wish they would test everyone getting off the cruise, but well, not enough info about our testing capacity to know if that's an unreasonable wish. Fingers crossed that everything will turn out fine.

Lol-ed at the Reverse Hotel California..

Ironically, some people are actually proposing that we quarantine the whole ship, maybe in a Hotel (California).

I think it would be easier to just send them to the quarantine facilities around singapore? Just charter like 30 buses, give the drivers a PPE, and transport them from the cruise to quarantine zone without interaction with the public or unprotected personnel.

How could they have been in Italy if they departed from SG, and have been at sea for the past 2 weeks??

=== Author: zkh77===
Fellow witcher

=== Author: redwithin===
I think if there was a single reported case on the ship we would have to assume that anyone could be infected. Everyone would either need to go to a quarantine facility or any locals would at the minimum need to stay at home.

Im the absence of this, we should refer to what our standing guidelines are, which I assume are:

Anyone who has been in an affected area (e.g. Italy) in the past 14 days will be considered higher risk. I do not know if any patients meet this criteria since the initial departure of the ship was Feb 26 and it came back to Singapore on March 3rd. Since it won't make sense to restrict their travel now, I think it would be fair to quarantine them until 14 days from when they last left a heavily affected area. I assume all of them will be tested as well. 

For all other passengers, they will need to undergo testing if they show symptoms. Otherwise they will only need to be traced if someone does get IDed with the virus.

It would probably be fair to test all high risk passengers (if they have had any symptoms and/or been to an affected area within 14 days) before letting anyone off the ship.

In the event someone is found positive it would make sense to quarantine somewhere else rather than the ship. From my understanding our quarantine facilities are nearly completely unoccupied now as the close contacts are all local and self quarantining at home.

Tldr: we should do due diligence but shouldn't assume that this is a plague ship.

=== Author: m3ltd0wn02===
Most likely if that is the case, then the inbound flights that carried these Italians into Singapore on their initial entry would have had reported cases already.

=== Author: Mozfel===
And now the cruise ship passengers spread out to hotels all over the country! Song bo ruling party & Singaporeans?

=== Author: redwithin===
Would be horrifying if they really checked in to the quarantine facility but were never able to leave...

If there was a real case where people on board were infected we should probably quarantine them. I just don't think we should assume that they are all infected when there's no evidence of it. 

Treat them the same as we would passengers from somewhere else in the world.

=== Author: redwithin===
I suppose one Government let them leave but another one stopped them from coming back instead... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Not a doctor, but so far, kids seem to be more resistant to COVID (at least according to fatality/infection rates).

Take precautions, like not sitting close to other people in the cinema and not touching your face. I'd be more concerned if you have parents/elderly that you might spread to.
